going well</a>, but I want to acknowledge that life can be difficult; it can be painful and sorrowful. And I want to assert that God is still good, even in this grim reality. God still provides for His children.\r\n\r\nTo understand this truth, we must make some distinctions: God's time is not our time, we do not have an accurate understanding of what is \u201cgood,\u201d and we have a warped view of what we deserve.\r\n\r\nGod exists on an eternal timeframe, as do we. Our souls are eternal. Our bodies will be renewed at the resurrection. Death is but a bump in the eternity of our lives. What we believe to be of urgent importance may be inconsequential in the light of eternity. God is good <i>forever</i>, even if right now it seems otherwise.\r\n\r\nWe tend to experience \u201cgoodness\u201d in the context of lessening pain and increasing pleasure. It is \u201cgood\u201d when I am spared a tragedy. It is \u201cgood\u201d when I receive rewards. And, truly, these are good things, but they are not goodness. If they were the extent of goodness, Christ would not have been sacrificed; He would not instruct us to carry our crosses also.[foot]Luke 9:23[/foot] Even our cultural stories acknowledge this. In our movies and literature, good emerges from conflict. The good guys are the ones that do what's right, though the world around them is filled with greed and selfishness.[foot]We relate even better to flawed heros because they're circumstances are much like our own: they aspire to do what is right even though they themselves are filled with greed and selfishness.[/foot] Goodness is higher than such base desires as evading pain and seeking pleasure. God is working for our redemption, and, in that context, pain and pleasure are irrelevant. God's goodness is a higher goodness, informed by the context of eternity. God is redeeming us for a time and place where there is no pain. We're just not there yet.\r\n\r\nBy living in a world where 100% of the population is broken, it's easy for us to view our state as better off than it is. We tell ourselves, \u201cI'm not as bad as that person,\u201d or \u201cI do more than most.\u201d We think that by being better than others, we deserve more in return, but we are all decisively broken, deserving nothing. If we deserved goodness from God, then it would not be called \u201cblessings.\u201d \r\n\r\nGod is giving us more than we deserve, in a manner that's better than we know, on a timeline that's beyond our cognitive ability.

I propose that Comfort Zones are obstacles in every form, whether you are attempting \"God-given tasks\" or \"every day tasks.\" They are obstacles because operating within them means that we are primarily making decisions out of fear: fear of pain, fear of humiliation.\r\n\r\nI have noticed something peculiar about Comfort Zones. I don't believe they exist. Let me clarify: they only exist if we let them exist. During my time traveling New Zealand, I was constantly \"out of my comfort zone;\" yet, I was not uncomfortable. To operate out of your comfort zone, you must make a shift in thinking. You must keep an open mind to the uncertain future, unknown experiences (or at least, that's what I had to do). Within this mindset, there is no comfort zone. Outside of the comfort zone, it disappears altogether.\r\n\r\nMarriage has served to enable the structure of my comfort zone. Instead of encouraging an open-minded acceptance of the unknown in store for me, it allows me to give away the common things I find uncomfortable. The more I avoid what is perceived to be uncomfortable, the more unknowns I regard as such. My comfort zone effectively shrinks, with me trapped inside.\r\n\r\nI am making a conscious effort to live outside of my comfort zone. I want to intentionally embrace that which I expect to be uncomfortable; not in a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_Man_(film)\">Yes Man</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Opposite\">George Costanza</a> manner. Rather, I hope to analyze my gut reactions, perceive my motives. If I am operating out of fear, living within my comfort zone, I want to crush it willingly, and forcefully with divinely enabled defiance.\r\n\r\nI want to see my comfort zone shrink into oblivion with me standing outside of it, free from fear, free from myself.

I do not know the hip indie bands, nor do I really follow popular music. I wouldn't say that I am involved in the contemporary Christian music scene either. I don't have a large music library. Let's just say that I am not active in my musical enjoyment pursuits.\r\n\r\nThat being the case, I can easily tell a difference between the quality of \"Christian\" and \"non-Christian\"[foot]I dislike the need to use these labels, as I think they are mostly used for marketing purposes. What is \"Christian music,\" music that has accepted Jesus as Lord and Savior? No, \"Christian music\" is music that is marketed towards the Christian subculture. Perhaps moving away from this is the first step towards the Church being an artistic leader.[/foot] music. I understand that the former may have a spiritual value that makes up for the lack of quality, but I don't care to address that here. I only want to address the quality and the affect of music critics on it.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://fiveriverschurchplant.blogspot.com/\">A friend of mine</a>, who is much more into music than I am, was telling me about an article that had studied the average ratings of music in the Christian music industry and the secular music industry. The results were predictable: the Christian music industry produced, on average, higher rated reviews than the secular music industry.\r\n\r\nWhy the difference? Surely \"Christian\" music is not, on average, better than \"secular\" music.\r\n\r\nI posit that, as part of Christian morality, negativity and overt criticism (especially of one's \"own\") is looked down upon. A Christian critic feels bad about giving a bad review of an album (particularly a \"Christian\" album).\r\n\r\nMy question is this: does this tendency create better music or mediocre music?\r\n\r\nDo honest, difficult-to-please critics actually raise standards and encourage the development of art, and is that missing in the Christian subculture? As a group of people who should be creating a culture of original beauty, has the pious acceptance of mediocrity crippled the Church's potential in this area?\r\n\r\nI wonder if a culture can be created within the Church that is driven by the incredible creativity of the God we worship.

These people are unusually gifted in a particular area and don't need teamwork for individual success. The article used a story to illustrate the idea:\r\n<blockquote>Imagine a group of kids working on a team-building exercise where the entire group must walk across a wire between two trees without touching the ground. After receiving instruction, all the kids talk at once about their ideas. Eventually, one child emerges as the natural leader, able to sort through the ideas and direct the group with purpose. While all this is happening, a few kids with exceptional balance have not been paying attention to the conversation of their peers, but have been traversing the wire several times with ease.</blockquote>\r\nThe article goes on to state that while some leaders may ignore these gifted outliers and others may try and control them, truly effective leaders harness the gifts of these individuals for the best success of the group.\r\n\r\nI don't care what effective leaders do.[foot]I do care about effective leadership, just not in the scope of this post.[/foot] What I'm concerned about here is the idea of this third dynamic to the traditional leader-follower paradigm.

So a user can search the entire site for their keywords with one click.\r\n\r\nHere's the code:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code class=\"language-php\">\r\n// Gets the referring URL and loads it into $referURL\r\nif(isset($_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'])) {\r\n  $referURL = $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'];\r\n\t\r\n  // Divide the referring URL by slashes, providing the source and search string\r\n  $referURL = explode  ( \"/\", $referURL );\r\n  if(count($referURL) >= 4) {\r\n    $source = $referURL[2];\r\n    $searchString = $referURL[3];\r\n\t\t\r\n    // Evaluate the search string depending on the referring browser\r\n    switch($source) {\r\n      case \"www.google.com\":\r\n        $query = extract_searchTerms($searchString, \"q=\", \"+\");\r\n        break;\r\n      case \"www.bing.com\":\r\n        $query = extract_searchTerms($searchString, \"q=\", \"+\");\r\n        break;\r\n      case \"search.yahoo.com\":\r\n        $query = extract_searchTerms($searchString, \"p=\", \"+\");\r\n        break;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nAnd here's the <code>extract_searchTerms</code> function:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\r\n<code>\r\nfunction extract_searchTerms(&$searchString, $searchParam, $searchDelimiter) {\r\n  // Remove everything before the URL search parameter\r\n  $searchString = strstr($searchString, $searchParam); \r\n  // Remove the search parameter and everything after the \"&\"\r\n  $searchString = substr($searchString, strlen($searchParam), strpos($searchString, '&') - strlen($searchParam));\r\n  // Separate the Search Keywords by the search delimiter\r\n  $searchString = explode($searchDelimiter, $searchString); \r\n  // Reunite the Search Keywords, separated by a space\r\n  $searchString = implode(\" \", $searchString); \r\n  return $searchString;\r\n}\r\n</code>\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThe last step is to load the $query variable as the Search Box value:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\r\n<code>\r\n&lt;!-- Call the created PHP variable for the Value attribute --&gt;\r\n&lt;input class=\"text-input\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;?php echo($query); ?&gt;\" /&gt;\r\n</code>\r\n</pre>\r\nSo that's it for Google, Bing, and Yahoo. To add another search engine, you just need to figure out how they're denoting the keywords in the http referrer.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Good practice? Too much work for too little return?\r\n\r\nYou could even take this a step further and redirect a user to the site's search results instead of serving an error page at all.

Bookshelf is a means to manage and display <a href=\"http://bookshelf.orangegnome.com\" title=\"Bookshelf\">books that I've read and would recommend</a>. It is two things: a website front to display the books and a custom <abbr title=\"Content Management System\">CMS</abbr> to manage the data for these books. As a personal project, a large part of it was getting a better grasp on PHP. I started working on it in March of this year, then I got busy with work and wasn't able to get back to it until about a month ago.[foot]It's been on the back burner for a while now, so I repeat that I'm happy to announce its launch.[/foot] If you're interested in some of the geekier aspects of the project, keep reading. Otherwise, head on over and <a href=\"http://bookshelf.orangegnome.com\" title=\"Bookshelf\">take a look</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2>The Website</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Minimal Images</h3>\r\n\r\nWhile the content itself is rather image heavy[foot]Each book has an image of its cover.[/foot], the site design only uses two images: one is the background texture, and the other is the background texture with a radial gradient. Everything else uses CSS. This keeps the page size small for fast loading and rendering.[foot]The size of a page, not counting book covers, is a mere 196kb un-gzipped.[/foot]\r\n\r\n<h3>Adaptive Design</h3>\r\nThe site was designed before I got my hands dirty with true responsive design, so the layout is static, adjusting at certain breakpoints. An interesting challenge with this was how to handle the fixed positioning changes between the breakpoints. The design concept is that scrolling the screen just scrolls the bookshelves and everything else stays the same. This just isn't practical at some screen sizes, so I had to decide at what points things needed to change, what elements needed to change and how they needed to change. My basic solution for handling smaller vertical sizes was to switch the fixed elements to absolute positioning, allowing the entire screen to scroll. As the width diminishes, the bookshelf filtering and sorting get moved to drop-downs within the bookshelf, while the book information element remains fixed. The next breakpoint loses the fixed positioning concept and moves the book information above the bookshelf.\r\n\r\n<h3>AJAXy</h3>\r\nSeeing as the site is rather simple, consisting of a single template, I wanted to leverage AJAX for the content loading. For users with javascript enabled, the only page load is for the about/home pages. All book navigation is loaded asynchronously, without page loads.\r\n\r\n<h3>Creating Shelves</h3>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_344\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"485\" caption=\"&quot;Orphaned&quot; books got a short shelf.\"]<a href=\"http://writings.orangegnome.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/bookshelf-orphan.jpg\"><img src=\"http://writings.orangegnome.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/bookshelf-orphan.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of an orphaned book\" title=\"Orphaned books got a short shelf.\" width=\"485\" height=\"194\" class=\"size-full wp-image-344\" /></a>[/caption]The shelves for each row are created by aligned multiple bottom borders on each book.[foot]Using the <a href=\"http://nicolasgallagher.com/multiple-backgrounds-and-borders-with-css2/\" title=\"Multiple Backgrounds and Borders with CSS 2.1\">technique described by Necolas</a>.[/foot] This provided a lot of flexibility for the number of books needed on a row, row heights, and other dimensional factors of the shelf, allowing me to adjust the number of books on a row for smaller screen sizes as needed. The downside was orphan books were on a short shelf. For the main design, there are three books per shelf. If the number of books wasn't divisible by three, there would be leftover books on the last shelf. To fix this, I used a combination of <code>:last-child</code> and <code>:nth-of-type</code> to style as needed:[foot]Browser compatibility: modern browsers, IE9+[/foot]\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>/* Books that are the last \r\nand single on a row */\r\n.books li:last-child:nth-of-type(3n+1) {\r\n  width: 100%;\r\n  padding-right: 4px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* Books that are last and are with \r\none other book on a row */\r\n.books li:last-child:nth-of-type(3n+2) {\r\n  width: 66%;\r\n  padding-right: 4px;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<h3>iPhone Icons</h3>\r\n<img alt=\"Apple Touch Icon for Bookshelf\" src=\"http://bookshelf.orangegnome.com/apple-touch-icon-114x114-precomposed.png\" title=\"Apple Touch Icon\" class=\"alignleft\" width=\"114\" height=\"114\" />I spent a good amount of time working on the iPhone icons for this site. These are the icons that show if you add the website to your home screen. I don't expect anyone to actually do that, but it's nice to have just in case.\r\n\r\n<h2>The Back End</h2>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_348\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"1422\" caption=\"The Back End\"]<a href=\"http://writings.orangegnome.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/bookshelf-admin.jpg\"><img src=\"http://writings.orangegnome.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/bookshelf-admin.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of the Bookshelf Admin Area\" title=\"Bookshelf Admin\" width=\"1422\" height=\"900\" class=\"size-full wp-image-348\" /></a>[/caption]The back end is rather bare bones. It has the default styles of the <a href=\"http://html5boilerplate.com/\" title=\"A rock-solid default for HTML5 awesome.\">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>.[foot]Well, the default styles as of March of this year. I believe they have changed some since then.[/foot] I tried to create modular system in which I could add or remove functionality as it may be desired. Currently there is a \"users\" module and a \"bookshelf\" module. The \"users\" module provides user creation and management functionality, while the bookshelf module provides the functionality for managing the book data as well as giving hooks to echo the data within a front-end template.\r\n\r\n<h3>Amazon Integration</h3>\r\nAt the suggestion of <a href=\"http://www.speakeasymedia.net/\" title=\"Garrett Kuk\">Garrett Kuk</a>, I integrated Amazon's API into the backend, allowing for book addition by <abbr title=\"Amazon Standard Identification Number\">ASIN</abbr>. This turned out to be a brilliant idea. It pulls all the information and then allows me to adjust and modify the details as I see fit. If for nothing other than automating the book cover image retrieval, resizing, and saving process, it's genius. Thanks, Garrett.\r\n\r\n<h2>Known Issues</h2>\r\nOf course, even at launch there are things that I would like to be different:\r\n<dl>\r\n\t<dt>Truly responsive design</dt>\r\n        <dd>Responsive design is easiest to implement from the beginning of a project. I didn't want to scratch everything I had done in March to do so, but someday.[foot]The proverbial <i>someday</i>.[/foot]</dd>\r\n  <dt>Cleaner back end infrastructure</dt>\r\n  <dd>I already have ideas to improve the back end of the system. I believe the fact that I have a product that works and I know how to make it better proves a successful personal project. I can apply these lessons to the next project that comes my way.[foot]Or that aforementioned <i>someday</i>.[/foot]</dd>\r\n  <dt>High resolution book covers</dt>\r\n  <dd>Book covers uploaded prior to my iPhone 4 testing are the exact sizes needed for the space. This means that on the iPhone's retina display, they have artifacts. I have already adjusted the code to save double resolution images, but I haven't done anything for the previously uploaded images. The ideal solution would be to implement a \"refetch and resize\" functionality to the back end to do them automatically all at once or individually, as desired.</dd>\r\n  <dt>Lack of Internet Explorer Support</dt>\r\n  <dd>I try not to waste too much time in IE for my personal projects, but I did take a quick look at IE9, and it works. IE currently does not support <code>history.pushState</code>, so I have left the browser history untouched for IE. IE users will have a harder time linking directly to a specific book. Many of the more advanced CSS doesn't work in IE8 and older, and the <code>:last-child:nth-of-type()</code> trick is probably ignored in IE8 or older.</dd>\r\n  <dt>iPhone Icon Corners</dt>\r\n  <dd>I'm using \"precomposed\" icons for the iPhone, meaning I'm telling the phone not to add the rounded corners and reflection. I'm pretty sure that the corners did not maintain consistency as I scaled the image. It's just another thing that would take a bit of time to confirm and fix.</dd>\r\n  <dt>Book Comments</dt>\r\n  <dd>I did not spend much time on my comments on the books. Some, though I highly recommend and really enjoyed, I could not remember well enough to write a decent description. Others got lost in the bulk adding of books. I hope to be able to better craft comments as I add books as I read them.\r\n  <dt>Back End Efficiency</dt>\r\n  <dd>I'm still very fresh with back end programming, but there are so many things that could improve the Bookshelf platform. It is still far too coupled with my site design.</dd>\r\n</dl>\r\n\r\nI'm sure there are other issues unknown. I hope you enjoy it.

As United States culture trends increasingly secular, it makes sense that holiday traditions would become more so as well. In fact, the greater distinctions we draw between true aspects of Christianity and cultural traditions, the better we will be able to articulate the truth of Christ. What do we gain, after all, from forcing holiday traditions to be labeled as \"Christmas?\" Is someone that calls their tree a \"Christmas Tree\" closer to knowing Christ than one that calls it a \"Holiday Tree?\" For the Christian, little of our Christmas traditions have anything to do with Christianity. There are only two aspects of a Christian celebration of Christmas that are unique to Christianity; these are the distinctions to which we should cling.\r\n<h2>The Birth of a Savior</h2>\r\nMany would agree that the true meaning of Christmas is Jesus, but the Christian understanding is more nuanced. We don't celebrate the birth of a religious founder or a great teacher. We celebrate the birth of God incarnate, the eternal God become flesh.\u00a0It's not that Jesus was born, it's that Christ was born. And Christ is not only the Savior, He is the Son of God, wholly human, wholly divine. We celebrate the incarnate God, the Savior come for the redemption of humanity.\r\n<h2>The Reason for the Season</h2>\r\nWe think that the season is Christmastime, but there's an actual Christian season that encompasses Christmas: Advent.[foot]Actually, there is a liturgical season of Christmastide, but it doesn't start until Christmas Eve. Culturally, most of our Christmas season is concurrent with Advent[/foot] Advent is a time of expectant preparation for the second coming of Christ. Christmas is the holiday and Advent is the season. During this time we remember the first coming of Christ and look forward to His return. It's easy for us to forget or ignore this crucial part of Christian theology. It sounds too far fetched, too fantastical, but it's an integral part of Christianity. Jesus talked about it,[foot]Matthew 24-25, Mark 13, Luke 21:5-36[/foot] Paul talked about it,[foot]1 Thessalonians 4:13-5:3, 2 Timothy 3:1-9[/foot] Peter talked about it,[foot]2 Peter 3[/foot] and John certainly talked about it.[foot]Revelation, anyone?[/foot] And if God became man, is this any more fantastical than that? For the Christian, the reason for the season is not strictly that Christ has come, but that He is also coming again.[foot]Amen. Come, Lord Jesus[/foot]\r\n<hr />\r\nThat God became flesh, was born and walked among us, and that He's coming again, these are the Christian celebrations in Christmas. Christmas traditions either point to these concepts or they don't, and if they don't they're not Christian traditions, they are cultural traditions. Cultural traditions aren't bad; we can certainly enjoy them, but there's no need to fight for them as part of the meaning of Christmas. We hold on to the birth of Christ and His second coming, secular culture can do what it wants with the rest.", "published": "2011-12-14T17:45:12Z", "updated": "2020-03-19T20:42:00.409Z", "author": 1, "category": 12, "slug": "secularism-and-the-true-meaning-of-christmas", "is_published": true, "syndicated_to_twitter": null, "syndicate_to_twitter": false, "tags": [255, 260, 278, 320]}}, {"model": "posts.post", "pk": 29, "fields": {"title": "Eli's Mood Throughout the Day: A Graph", "summary": "", "content": "[caption id=\"attachment_428\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"518\" caption=\"Eli&#039;s Mood Throughout the Day\"]<a href=\"http://writings.orangegnome.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/elis-mood.png\"><img src=\"http://writings.orangegnome.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/elis-mood-518x198.png\" alt=\"An area graph depicting Eli&#039;s mood throughout the day and correlated daily milestones.\" title=\"Eli&#039;s Mood Throughout the Day\" width=\"518\" height=\"198\" class=\"size-large wp-image-428\" /></a>[/caption]", "published": "2011-12-20T21:43:50Z", "updated": "2020-03-19T20:42:00.543Z", "author": 1, "category": 10, "slug": "elis-mood-throughout-the-day-graph", "is_published": true, "syndicated_to_twitter": null, "syndicate_to_twitter": false, "tags": [321, 322, 323]}}, {"model": "posts.post", "pk": 30, "fields": {"title": "Hobbyist, Professional, Craftsman, Artist", "summary": "", "content": "For any given activity, I propose the following operational definitions:\r\n\r\n<dl>\r\n<dt>Hobbyist</dt>\r\n<dd>One who pays money to do the activity.</dd>\r\n<dt>Professional</dt>\r\n<dd>One who gets paid to do the activity.</dd>\r\n<dt>Craftsman</dt>\r\n<dd>One who sweats the smallest of details involving the activity.</dd>\r\n<dt>Artist</dt>\r\n<dd>One who transcends the activity and uses the activity as a tool to communicate higher level ideas.</dd>\r\n</dl>\r\n\r\nThe only two that are mutually exclusive are hobbyist and professional.[foot]Though even this is debatable.

Even so, I thought I would lay out how I, through implementation and experience, have come to view its place in the world of web development. According to the author of the book on this subject,[foot]Ethan Marcotte, <i><a href=\"http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design\" title=\"Responsive Web Design by Ethan Marcotte\">Responsive Web Design</a></i>[/foot] responsive web design is comprised of three things:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Flexible Grid</li>\r\n\t<li>Flexible Images</li>\r\n\t<li>Media Queries</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>A Declaration of Terms</h2>\r\nFor the sake of clarity, I call a variation of this which doesn't use the flexible grid[foot]and, subsequently, flexible images[/foot] \"Adaptive Web Design.\" It really doesn't matter, they both serve the same goal. A design that uses a flexible grid, but doesn't use media queries is a fluid width design. All of these would be viewed in contrast with fixed width design. \r\n\r\nResponsive web design is a fluid width design that employs media queries to make key adjustments at awkward widths. When the screen width is too narrow for two columns, the design moves to a one column layout. Adaptive web design is a series of fixed width designs that shift at specific breakpoints.\r\n\r\n<h2>What Responsive Web Design Is, and What It is Not</h2>\r\n\r\nAnd the goal of responsive web design?[foot]Or adaptive. Just assume that these are interchangeable for the article, even if the exact implementation differs.[/foot] Device agnosticism. Or, more accurately, viewport[foot]The viewport being the screen size and resolution.[/foot] agnosticism.\r\n\r\nThe misrepresentation that results in detractors is that the method is a mobile device solution. It is not. It may be part of a mobile device solution, but it, in itself, is not.\r\n\r\nThe reality of today's web environment is that people are accessing sites from a multitude of viewports. Responsive web design is a means to design in a way that does not discriminate against that variety. It is a flexible approach to a flexible medium.\r\n\r\nResponsive web design does not provide solutions for resource limitations, such as low bandwidth, limited memory, or javascript functionality. We should be designing and developing websites that address those issues already. Nor does responsive web design address a user's context, information relevance while walking down a sidewalk versus sitting in an office. It's tempting to assume context by screen size, but we don't have enough information to make that call.\r\n\r\n<h2>The Role of Responsive Web Design</h2>\r\n\r\nSo where does responsive web design fit into a web strategy? All general purpose websites should be responsive. The content should all be available regardless of screen size or device. Don't assume the users intentions for your main website. If the main website is too resource heavy[foot]See one previous paragraph.[/foot] or you deem that your users have specific mobile needs that should be addressed differently from your website, by all means develop a mobile-specific site or a mobile app, but let the user choose to interact in that context. And never deny them the full information on your main site.\r\n\r\nPlay to the strengths of each implementation: responsive web design, mobile-specific sites, and native apps. Use responsive web design to remain agnostic to a users device and context, use mobile sites to address a mobile context, and use native apps to achieve a more device-integrated experience than possible online.", "published": "2012-02-09T20:58:46Z", "updated": "2020-03-19T20:42:00.572Z", "author": 1, "category": 13, "slug": "pragmatic-perspective-responsive-web-design", "is_published": true, "syndicated_to_twitter": null, "syndicate_to_twitter": false, "tags": [285, 344, 345, 346, 347, 348, 349, 350]}}, {"model": "posts.post", "pk": 35, "fields": {"title": "The First Beer", "summary": "", "content": "[caption id=\"attachment_490\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"341\" caption=\"The finished product.\"]<a href=\"http://writings.orangegnome.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/first-beer-pale-ale.jpg\"><img src=\"http://writings.orangegnome.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/first-beer-pale-ale-341x255.jpg\" alt=\"Pale Ale\" title=\"Pale Ale\" width=\"341\" height=\"255\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-490\" /></a>[/caption]For the past few years, I have wanted to brew my own beer. I have put it off until homeownership due to space concerns while renting. Space concerns weren't really alleviated when we purchased a house, but it had been my milestone for so long, I went ahead and put the equipment on my Christmas list. I had first mentioned it to <a href=\"http://danieldewittmusic.com/\" title=\"Daniel DeWitt\">Daniel</a>[foot]And can I just say, it was great brewing with Daniel. I don't know how I would've done it by myself.[/foot] when he purchased a home a couple of years ago. He was intrigued, but we never acted until I got the equipment. And here we are.\n\nI'm not sure why I am so interested in creating the things I enjoy, but I do. It is not uncommon for me to suggest to my wife that we try to make something ourselves. It is also not uncommon that she be less than enthused about the idea. It's probably for the better. I think I enjoy what I learn by doing it myself. In this case, I've learned a lot about malts, hops, yeast, and fermentation, much more than I have by only enjoying the end product.\n\nWe brewed the \"First Batch\" recipe that was in the booklet that came with the equipment. It's about as basic as it could be: light malt extract, cascade hops, and ale yeast.[foot]It didn't even specify what kind of yeast. <a href=\"http://www.wyeastlab.com/\" title=\"Wyeast\">Which</a> <a href=\"http://www.whitelabs.com/\" title=\"White Labs\">are</a> <a href=\"http://www.fermentis.com/\" title=\"Fermentis\">numerous</a>.[/foot] What resulted after 2 weeks in the fermenter and another couple of weeks in the bottle was a very pale ale. The recipe claimed to be a pale ale; the guy at the <a href=\"http://www.aleyeahbeer.com/\" title=\"Ale Yeah!\">homebrew store</a>, after looking at the recipe, said that it would be \"pale-ish.\" It's a little darker than your average Bud/Miller/Coors and a little lighter than your average Sweetwater 420/Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. The flavor was right in the latter's area. A good balance of hops and malt. The mouthfeel is a bit on the light side for an American pale ale, but it tastes good. It tastes really good. I am really quite proud of our first batch.\n\nSuccessfully fermenting something was an odd feeling. It kind of felt like creating fire: that odd mix of awe and power-tripping that comes from playing a role in something that happens completely on its own. Having 5 gallons of fermenting liquid in the closet also felt a little illegal.\n\nHere are some pictures:\n[caption id=\"attachment_493\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"518\" caption=\"Daniel Stirring the Wort\"]<a href=\"http://writings.orangegnome.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/first-beer-wort-e1329872450847.jpg\"><img src=\"http://writings.orangegnome.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/first-beer-wort-e1329872450847-518x386.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Stirring the Wort\" title=\"Daniel Stirring the Wort\" width=\"518\" height=\"386\" class=\"size-large wp-image-493\" /></a>[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_489\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"518\" caption=\"The beer, in the closet, fermenting away.\"]<a href=\"http://writings.orangegnome.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/first-beer-carboy-e1329872576786.jpg\"><img src=\"http://writings.orangegnome.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/first-beer-carboy-e1329872576786-518x386.jpg\" alt=\"Fermenting Beer\" title=\"Fermenting Beer\" width=\"518\" height=\"386\" class=\"size-large wp-image-489\" /></a>[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_488\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"518\" caption=\"Daniel prepping bottles like a boss.\"]<a href=\"http://writings.orangegnome.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/first-beer-bottling.jpg\"><img src=\"http://writings.orangegnome.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/first-beer-bottling-518x388.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Prepping Bottles\" title=\"Daniel Prepping Bottles\" width=\"518\" height=\"388\" class=\"size-large wp-image-488\" /></a>[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_487\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"518\" caption=\"Bottles, ready to condition.\"]<a href=\"http://writings.orangegnome.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/first-beer-bottles.jpg\"><img src=\"http://writings.orangegnome.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/first-beer-bottles-518x388.jpg\" alt=\"Bottles, Ready to Condition\" title=\"Bottles, Ready to Condition\" width=\"518\" height=\"388\" class=\"size-large wp-image-487\" /></a>[/caption]", "published": "2012-02-22T01:10:03Z", "updated": "2020-03-19T20:42:00.578Z", "author": 1, "category": 15, "slug": "the-first-beer", "is_published": true, "syndicated_to_twitter": null, "syndicate_to_twitter": false, "tags": [351]}}, {"model": "posts.post", "pk": 36, "fields": {"title": "Facebook Social Plugins Overflow Bug", "summary": "encountered a weird bug that was causing overflow on the body element in Firefox and Opera.

These guys are now the owners. I don't know if my palate has improved over the years or if the coffee is actually better,[foot]I do wonder how the general sense of ownership affects the final product. The place certainly seemed to get busier after the operators assumed ownership.[/foot] but, as Steady Hand, the spot has really come into its own.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the excellent espresso drinks, Steady Hand offers coffee brewed to order by <a href=\"http://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/\" title=\"Chemex Brand Site\">Chemex</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_coffee_maker\" title=\"Wikipedia Article\">siphon</a>, which are the best brewed coffees I have ever tasted. They are so good that choosing between them or an espresso drink is a difficult decision in which no one loses.\r\n\r\nConveniently, there is a parking lot just behind their neighbor, Everybody's Pizza, that is for patrons of Steady Hand and Everybody's. Inconveniently, this lot is aggressively defended against illegitimate parkers. I say \"aggressively\" because I have been erroneously booted twice while at Steady Hand with the claim that I had crossed over to Emory.\r\n\r\nThe guys at Steady Hand have been outstanding in confirming my presence in their shop and helping me get the erroneous boot off of my car, but the problem still stands. I can understand the mistake once, but twice? There is a flaw in the implementation.\r\n\r\nA sense of helplessness looms large over the whole situation. In the moment, it is my word[foot]backed by Steady hand[/foot] against their word. I've been trying to understand how I have twice been mistakenly booted and I can only think of two things: I have an Emory student doppelganger, or, since I park towards the far end of the lot and have a laptop bag, it is assumed that I am walking over to Emory. It is obvious that I'm not being watched the whole time, otherwise I wouldn't[foot] or at least shouldn't[/foot] be getting booted.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to move forward from here: I'm not doing anything wrong, the coffee is really good, and I like going there. I asked the booter what I can do to avoid this, and he responded with \"You can park here all day so long as you stay at Steady Hand.\" History shows that to be inaccurate. Here are some other ideas I had:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Look for someone watching the lot when I arrive. Yell to them, \"Hey! Are you watching the lot? I'm going to Steady Hand, care to walk me over there?\" Pros: No mistaking where I went. Cons: High jerk factor, which may result in a spite-booting.</li>\r\n\t<li>Generally shout in the parking lot \"Hey! I'm parking here and going to Steady Hand!\" and hope that whoever is responsible hears and understands. Pros: If I call attention to myself, perhaps they'll watch the entire journey to the Steady Hand. Cons: It's too similar to muttering to myself or talking to voices in my head.</li>\r\n\t<li>Tape a sign on my window saying, \"I'm in Steady Hand. Please come verify that I am not before you boot my car.\" Pros: Less noise disturbance and gets the message across. Cons: They may not care to verify.</li>\r\n\t<li>Park somewhere else. Pros: Solves the issue. Cons: <em>They</em> win.</li>\r\n\t<li>Bring my own boot and beat them to the punch. Pros: It <em>could</em> work. Cons: Must purchase and haul a car boot; there are 3 more wheels left vulnerable.[foot]Suggested by <a href=\"http://www.speakeasymedia.net/\" title=\"Rico. Suave.\">Garrett</a>.[/foot]</li>\r\n\t<li>Ride my bike there. Pros: Definitely solves the issue; better health. Cons: Weather exposure; will have to haul Eli to daycare in his trailer.[foot]Suggested by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/jboerckel\" title=\"Cycling Fiend\">Joel</a>.[/foot]</li>\r\n\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nReally, though, the lot watchers need a change of strategy. The false positives are too frequent and the trouble caused is too great to continue with their current practice. Switching to a form of parking validation would be better, though I imagine it would be difficult to manage people patronizing more of Emory Village than just Everybody's or Steady Hand.

All that varies is how well we observe the growth of others.

What happens when there's been enough time for them to hurt you? Or for you to hurt them?

Only the men were to be relocated, the women, children, and elderly were to be shot on the spot. The men of the battalion were not officially informed, but some had a hint of what was to come. Two platoons were to surround the village, with explicit orders to shoot anyone trying to escape. The remaining men were to round up the Jews, shooting any that were sick or frail, as well as infants and anyone offering resistance.[foot]Christopher Browning, <i>Ordinary Men.</i>[/foot]\r\n\r\nWe live in a broken world. This story of Reserve Police Battalion 101 is recounted in Christopher Browning's Ordinary People. Human history is filled with atrocities like this massacre: slavery, human trafficking, violent power struggles. We try to make distinctions between the bad people and the good people. We create laws declaring what constitutes good and what constitutes bad. We seek out and incarcerate the bad. We remark on accounts like this with comments such as, \u201cWhat kind of monster could do that?\u201d or \u201cI could never do something like that.\u201d \r\n\r\nWe tell ourselves that we are good and they are bad.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that I know, deep within me, that I am among the bad. I have not been convicted of any crimes, but I have stolen, I have wished ill towards others, and I have thought first and last only about my own well-being.\r\n\r\nWorse, I have done things that I had previously thought myself incapable of doing. When that happens, you realize a scary truth: given the right circumstances I am more than capable of evil.\r\n\r\nThis is the conclusion Browning makes. Reserve Police Battalion 101 was not made up of hardened soldiers. It was made up of middle aged, working-class men. He concludes: \r\n\r\n<blockquote>Except for a few of the oldest men who were veterans of World War I, and a few NCOs who had been transferred to Poland from Russia, the men of the battalion had not seen battle or encountered a deadly enemy. Most of them had not fired a shot in anger or ever been fired on, much less lost comrades fighting at their side. Thus, wartime brutalization through prior combat was not an immediate experience directly influencing the men's behavior at Jozefow. In this sense, brutalization was not the cause but the effect of these men's behavior.[foot]Ibid.[/foot]</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThere are not good and bad people, broken and unbroken people. We are all broken. We are all capable of the unthinkable. We aren't broken because we do bad, but because we consistently cannot do good. \r\n\r\nG.K. Chesterton, an English writer living in the late 1800s, early 1900s, was invited by a newspaper to submit an essay on the topic \u201cWhat's Wrong with the World.\u201d Chesterton responded with a letter that simply read, \u201cDear sirs, I am.\u201d[foot]<a href=\"http://lilgn.me/dearsirs\" title=\"Google Search Results for 'Chesterton Dear Sirs I Am'\">I couldn't find an original source, but the story is everywhere.</a>[/foot]\r\n\r\nThe apostle Paul describes his experience in Romans with these words, \"I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do, I do not do, but what I hate, I do.\"[foot]Romans 7:15[/foot]\r\n\r\nWe are broken at a much deeper level than our action. We are broken in the very root of our being.\r\n\r\n<h2>God Loves Us So Much</h2>\r\n\r\nIt is in this context of brokenness that God enters. The recorded history of the Israelites, God's Chosen People, is story after story of brokenness and restoration.\r\n\r\nGod leads the Israelites out of their life of slavery in Egypt, God appears to them at Mt. Sinai and leads them through the desert. They complain and disobey. God still delivers them into the promised land and establishes their kingdom. Time after time, they move to disobedience, and time after time, God calls them to return to him. The prophets were the voice of God, calling the Israelites back to Him. There are over 30 prophets recorded in the Old Testament.\r\n\r\nThe prophet Hosea was called to rather visibly demonstrate this cycle to the Israelites. God instructed him to marry an unfaithful wife, \u201cGo, take to yourself an adulterous wife and children of unfaithfulness, because the land is guilty of the vilest adultery in departing from the LORD.\u201d[foot]Hosea 1:2[/foot] Then, after she had been unfaithful, He tells Hosea, \u201cGo, show your love to your wife again, though she is loved by another and is an adulterous. Love her as the Lord loves the Israelites, though they turn to other gods.\u201d[foot]Hosea 3:1[/foot]\r\n\r\nThe Israelites abandon their God, He calls them to repent and return to Him, and, when they do, He forgives them. Over and over again.\r\n\r\nIt is this same God who enters the physical timeline of humanity as Jesus, the son of God, who shows us what an unbroken life looks like.  He lives with us, eats with us, and teaches us God's character and our character. Further, He dies so that we can experience wholeness. Unbroken, eternal son of God volunteers to be broken, so that we can be made whole. He dies for us.\r\n\r\nAnd, on top of that, He comes back to life. He heals our brokenness and conquers death. He shows us the path to wholeness and to life. And He invites us to join Him. That is the love of God.\r\n\r\nIn college once, I was telling my roommates about something stupid I had done, and I remarked, \u201cI wonder what God thinks when he watches me.\u201d Immediately, one of my roommates responded: \u201cHe's thinking, 'I love him so much.'\u201d And that's the truth. We are broken, unworthy, and God loves us so much.\r\n\r\n<h2>An Appropriate Response</h2>\r\n\r\nHow do we respond to such overwhelming love? God asks for one thing: surrender. Trying harder doesn't work. We can't be whole on our own, nor can we conquer death on our own. The broken and the doomed have no power of restoration. No, it is the active abandonment of trying that leads to healing and life.\r\n\r\nSurrender is an amazing paradox. It is intentional giving up. It is not losing, or being overcome. It is active inaction. To surrender our lives to God, is a form of death. We die to our own desires, to our own wants. This is the paradox that Jesus presents when he says that his burden his light,[foot]Matthew 11:28&ndash;30[/foot] but also commands us to carry our crosses.[foot]Luke 9:23[/foot] Surrender is death, but it results in relief. The crucifixion itself was the supreme act of surrender: Jesus surrendered His will to God on the Mount of Olives[foot]Matthew 26:36&ndash;39, Mark 14:32&ndash;36, Luke 22:39&ndash;44[/foot] and then surrendered His spirit on the cross, saying \u201cFather, into your hands I commit my spirit.\u201d[foot]Luke 23:46, John 19:30[/foot] But the story doesn't end there, He conquers death and is raised back to life.[foot]Matthew 28:1&ndash;7, Mark 16:1&ndash;7, Luke 24:1&ndash;12, John 20:10&ndash;18[/foot] He surrenders everything, and comes back to life.\r\n\r\nJesus says in Matthew:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.\r\n\r\nAgain, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls. When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it.[foot]Matthew 13:44&ndash;46[/foot]</blockquote>\r\n\r\nWhen Paul writes about dying with Jesus so that we can live with Him,[foot]Romans 6:5, Romans 8:17, Philippians 3:10&ndash;11[/foot] he's talking about surrendering. We sacrifice our will, and we receive life from God. This is the man who found a treasure in a field and sold everything to buy the field. This is the merchant who sold everything for the pearl of great value. This is how whoever wants to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for Jesus will find it.[foot]Luke 9:24[/foot]\r\n\r\nWe surrender to God and receive life.\r\n\r\n<h2>What \"Surrender\" Looks Like</h2>\r\n\r\nTalking about \u201csurrendering\u201d is easy, but what does it look like, practically? There are two ways that I see it playing out in everyday life. \r\n\r\nFirst, is  intentional surrender. Intentional surrender is through exercises like prayer, meditating, and fasting. Or even less talked about exercises such as simplicity, solitude, and service. We take time to intentionally surrender our will to God's will, or our wealth and time to his purposes. We take time to seek out places in our lives on which we have death grips, and surrender them to God, or, at the very least, we ask God for the grace to surrender them to Him.\r\n\r\nThese intentional acts of surrender are commonly known as spiritual disciplines. And that's their point, to put us in a position of surrender that allows God to transform us. God transforms, we just have to get out of the way.\r\n\r\nRichard Foster explains it this way: \r\n\r\n<blockquote>By themselves the Spiritual Disciplines can do nothing; they can only get us to the place where something can be done. The needed change within us is God's work, not ours. The demand is for an inside job, and only God can work from the inside.\u201d[foot]Richard Foster, <i>Celebration of Discipline</i>[/foot]</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe second from of surrender is circumstantial surrender. This requires a sensitivity to our surroundings, our attitude, and, frequently, the promptings of the Holy Spirit. It can be surrendering my frustration during a traffic jam, or it can be surrendering my time to a friend in need, or even a stranger in need.\r\n\r\nThis circumstantial surrender is a life of love. The Apostle John writes in his first letter: \r\n\r\n<blockquote>Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.[foot]1 John 4:7&ndash;11[/foot]</blockquote>\r\n\r\nWe are all broken, and God loves us so much. We surrender in loving obedience for restorative transformation.", "published": "2012-06-18T01:25:31Z", "updated": "2020-03-19T20:42:00.621Z", "author": 1, "category": 12, "slug": "christianity-as-i-understand-it", "is_published": true, "syndicated_to_twitter": null, "syndicate_to_twitter": false, "tags": [260, 272, 273, 374, 375, 376]}}, {"model": "posts.post", "pk": 43, "fields": {"title": "JonathanHolston.org has Launched", "summary": "", "content": "I'm a bit late publishing my writeup, but JonathanHolston.org launched a couple of months ago. <a href=\"http://www.lineberrydesign.com/portfolio/jonathanholston-org/\" title=\"JonathanHolston,org, Designed and Developed by Lineberry Design\">Read a little about the process at lineberrydesign.com</a>.", "published": "2012-06-30T19:18:11Z", "updated": "2020-03-19T20:42:00.627Z", "author": 1, "category": 13, "slug": "jonathanholston-org-has-launched", "is_published": true, "syndicated_to_twitter": null, "syndicate_to_twitter": false, "tags": [315, 317, 377, 378]}}, {"model": "posts.post", "pk": 44, "fields": {"title": "WordPress 3.4 and Captions", "summary": "", "content": "WordPress 3.4 changed the shortcode syntax for image captions.

It's like a regular button, but the left side is an arrow? I think that's a wonderful visual cue for what the button does, and I recently implemented it for a web app at work. Here's how I did it.\r\n\r\n<h2>Requirements:</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#search=border-radius\" title=\"Border-radius Browser Compatibility\">Border-radius</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#search=transform\" title=\"CSS3 Transforms Browser Compatibility\">CSS Transforms</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nThe idea is to break the link into three parts: \r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>the actionable link,</li>\r\n\t<li>the main box of the button, and</li>\r\n        <li>the triangle/arrow of the button.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Actionable Link</h2>\r\nThe HTML for this is simple:\r\n\r\n[prettyprint lang=\"html\"]&lt;a class=\"btn-back\" href=\"#\"&gt;Back&lt;/a&gt;[/prettyprint]\r\n\r\nOf course, you can use a <code>button</code> or whatever element fits your needs.\r\n\r\nThe basic styles for the link are:\r\n[prettyprint lang=\"css\"].btn-back {\r\n    display: inline-block;\r\n    position: relative;\r\n    z-index: 1;\r\n    padding: 0 10px 0 30px;\r\n    \r\n    line-height: 44px;\r\n}[/prettyprint]\r\n\r\nUsing <code>inline-block</code> allows the button width to size dynamically to the content. The <code>position</code> and <code>z-index</code> are to position our pseudoelements. The <code>padding</code> and <code>line-height</code> are to position our link within the button. This code gets us this:\r\n\r\n<pre class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"300\" data-type=\"result\" data-href=\"pntsI\" data-user=\"blineberry\"><code></code></pre>\r\n<script async src=\"http://codepen.io:/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Main Box</h2>\r\nA pseudoelement is used for the main box of the button: \r\n[prettyprint lang=\"css\"].btn-back:before {\r\n    content: '';\r\n    \r\n    position: absolute;\r\n    box-sizing: border-box;\r\n    left: 20px;\r\n    right: 0;\r\n    height: 34px;\r\n    margin-top: 5px;\r\n    z-index: -1;\r\n    \r\n    border: 1px solid #000;\r\n    border-left-width: 0;\r\n    border-radius: 5px;\r\n}[/prettyprint]\r\n\r\nThe box is positioned absolutely to and behind the link. It's given a border on all sides except for the left side, and the <code>border-radius</code> gives it the familiar \"button\" look.\r\n\r\nThe button now looks like this:\r\n<pre class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"300\" data-type=\"result\" data-href=\"doywr\" data-user=\"blineberry\"><code></code></pre>\r\n\r\nWe could drop a pseudoelement and apply these styles directly to the link, but separating them allows us to separate the size of the target from the visual size of the button. On a touch device, for example, the target area for the link could be bigger than the visual size of the button to allow for less accurate tapping.\r\n\r\n<h2>The Triangle/Arrow</h2>\r\nSo far everything's been pretty standard CSS fare. Pseudoelements are rather widely supported. This next bit makes use of CSS transforms which are less well supported. Concessions could be made[foot]via <a href=\"http://modernizr.com/\" title=\"Modernizr is a feature detection library\">Modernizr</a> or some other form of feature detection[/foot] at this point to allow unsupportive browsers to be shown a standard button by adding back the left border. For browsers that support it, this gets the full effect:\r\n\r\n[prettyprint lang=\"CSS\"].btn-back:after {\r\n    content: '';\r\n    \r\n    position: absolute;\r\n    box-sizing: border-box;\r\n    left: 11px;\r\n    height: 27px;\r\n    width: 26px;\r\n    top: 8px;\r\n    z-index: -2;\r\n    \r\n    border: 1px solid #000;\r\n    border-top: 0 transparent;\r\n    border-right: 0 transparent;\r\n    border-radius: 7px 5px 5px 7px;\r\n    \r\n    -webkit-transform: rotate(45deg);\r\n}[/prettyprint]\r\n\r\nThis pseudoelement is just another box rotated 45 degrees. Using a transform instead of a CSS triangle allows for a lot more possibilities. It gets positioned behind everything else to help hide any weird artifacts. Some browsers will show some bits of top and right borders even though they've been removed.[foot]I'm sure it's just a rendering issue[/foot] The border is massaged a little to help mesh with the main box.\r\n\r\nThe final button:\r\n\r\n<pre class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"300\" data-type=\"result\" data-href=\"EwCIq\" data-user=\"blineberry\"><code></code></pre>\r\n\r\n<h2>More</h2>\r\nThe button is rather skeletal at the moment. At this point it is very versatile and can be dressed up to match the design of it's environment. A few customizations and we have this:\r\n\r\n<pre class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"300\" data-type=\"result\" data-href=\"qnLIs\" data-user=\"blineberry\"><code></code></pre>\r\n\r\nI like this technique. It provides an intuitive fallback for browsers that don't support key properties, and it provides a lot of flexibility for styling and implementation. It does require a fixed height, though, because the measurements for the boxes have to be exact for it to look right.", "published": "2012-09-17T03:19:24Z", "updated": "2020-03-19T20:42:00.639Z", "author": 1, "category": 13, "slug": "ios-style-back-button-in-css", "is_published": true, "syndicated_to_twitter": null, "syndicate_to_twitter": false, "tags": [282, 296, 379, 380]}}, {"model": "posts.post", "pk": 46, "fields": {"title": "Fried Egg Toast", "summary": "", "content": "Fried Egg Toast has become one of my all-time favorite breakfasts and a go-to morning meal.

In my mind, it's as close to a perfect church that I've ever been a part of, and I feel so fortunate to be a part of it. When I try and describe it, I feel like all I have are buzzwords: real, authentic, genuine, community. But it's true. There is a genuineness that I find so refreshing. Honest questions are welcome. Life is acknowledged as the mess that it often is. When we find ourselves without answers, we feel okay leaving it at that. Somehow, we are distanced from the trends of contemporary Christian culture. I have no idea what the prevailing popular doctrines and controversies are, and I love that.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it's easier to contrast what I think is the foundational characteristic of my church with what is a foundational characteristic of most churches. I have found most churches to be programs-oriented. For many churches, ministry equals programs. There's interest in helping the homeless? Start a feed and clothe the homeless program. There's interest in music? Start a choir program. Obviously a Sunday School program is needed. And don't forget about Wednesday night suppers. Everything revolves around events and programs and committees that manage the programs and the people that come to the programs and the people that are sought to come to the programs.\r\n\r\nMy church is a little different: we're relationship-oriented. We gather for each other, to encourage each other, to support each other. I don't think of my friends from church as my \"church friends.\" I see them as my friends, and church is what we do together. I think this focus is wonderful. It is what allows the intimacy and vulnerability that's needed for authenticity and community. \r\n\r\nAs we grow and mature as a church, though, there are significant obstacles that I'm wrestling with. \r\n\r\nThe major obstacle is the correlation between relationships and size. One can only have so many close friendships. Friendships take time and emotional investment, both of which are limited. Up to a certain size, we're all friends; the church is one large group of friends. Then it gets too big, so we start breaking into small groups. But what happens when we're all in our smaller groups, at our relational limit and visitors come? We can't expect them to bring their own group of friends. That's not becoming a part of a church. Our relational focus places a limit on our size, a limit that keeps out people that may fit well with us, people that could really use the authentic love we have to offer. Cliques are necessary for relational intimacy, but are detrimental to ministering to those outside of it.\r\n\r\nI'm beginning to wonder how I should approach church on Sundays. I love my friends, but perhaps Sunday morning should be about ministering to those I don't know. Welcoming them, introducing them to others, helping them find out how to connect with others in the church. Most of the questions people have in our church are not answered by pamphlets or informative materials, they are answered by people. It's a symptom of our relational focus. I may have limits on my relational commitments, but I can help people connect with people. I don't need to be close with everyone; I can help others get closer to each other.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking the strategy is to be outwards focused on Sundays, help connect people to people, and then rest in the stability of my close friendships during the week.[foot]And you, fellow church friend, do not take this as a block against our friendship. It isn't. I would love to get to know you better. It just takes time, and time is limited.[/foot] Time will tell if this is a sustainable approach to combining broad and deep community.", "published": "2012-10-02T03:40:41Z", "updated": "2020-03-19T20:42:00.651Z", "author": 1, "category": 12, "slug": "on-a-major-obstacle-to-relational-church", "is_published": true, "syndicated_to_twitter": null, "syndicate_to_twitter": false, "tags": [255, 260, 276, 386]}}, {"model": "posts.post", "pk": 48, "fields": {"title": "Pumpkin Spice Syrup", "summary": "", "content": "Last year I made pumpkin spice lattes using a bit of canned pumpkin and spices.

It becomes an essential approach when dealing with large sites maintained over time. Here are some thoughts on our recent redesign of <a title=\"Goizueta Business School, Emory University\" href=\"http://goizueta.emory.edu\">Goizueta's main external site</a>.\n<h2>Think in Components</h2>\nWhen designing, don't think in terms of page templates, think of components that are assembled as pages. Each component is its own, independent piece that is fitted with others to make up pages. For Goizueta, each component has its own CSS file, and, if necessary, its own JavaScript file. Write components to be fluid width, agnostic to their placement within a page; let their width be implicitly determined by their containing elements. This makes it a relatively minor issue to move components into new contexts.\n<h2>Extend, Extend, Extend</h2>\nRead <a title=\"SMACSS\" href=\"http://smacss.com/\">Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS</a> and apply what you've read. Start everything component from a generic implementation and extend with classes to more specific implementations. Let your basic HTML elements look like what they are. <a title=\"Normalize.css\" href=\"http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/\">Don't reset styles, normalize styles</a>. The first pass at styling a component should be as flexible as possible. Extend the component with additional, optional classes to modify its behavior for more specific instances. Make your CSS selectors as least specific as possible. Cascade styles with the minimum specificity required. Don't tie component styling to page regions.\n<h2>Encapsulate Your JavaScript, Expose an Interface</h2>\nA component that requires JavaScript is a component that requires a JavaScript object. If the component needs to be easily accessible to other components, write it as a module pattern in the global scope, exposing only the properties and methods needed. Otherwise write it within an immediately invoked function expression. If using jQuery, write a plugin interface for you objects. Write your JS objects with callbacks and triggers. Make it easy for \u00a0components to connect to each others' functionality as and when needed. You don't know all the ways you may want access at the beginning.\n<h2>Use a CSS Preprocessor</h2>\nCSS preprocessors are the biggest influences for more productive front-end development that I've seen. Use one. I use <a href=\"http://sass-lang.com/\">SASS</a>. SASS + SMACSS is a winning formula.\n<h2>Package Your Assets</h2>\nWith the modular, component approach, you end up with a whole lot of CSS and JS files. Separate your components into global, section, and page frequencies, and package your CSS and JS accordingly. You should have a global.js file \u00a0that contains all of your scripts that are required on 99% of pages, several [section].js files that contain scripts unique to specific sections, and [component].js files for components that are not consistently used in the site or a section.\u00a0Same thing for CSS, except don't use [component].css files. CSS needs to be loaded to prevent <abbr title=\"Flash Of Unstyled Content\">FOUC</abbr>. So you'll just have global.css and [section].css.\n\nMinify your CSS with your preprocessor. Uglify and minify your JS with a build tool like <a title=\"Grunt.js\" href=\"http://gruntjs.com/\">grunt.js</a>.\n<h2>Load As Needed</h2>\nIt should be obvious that every page will load the global.js and global.css, and that each section will load its [section].js and [section].css, but what about the [component].js scripts? Use a resource loader. For each component that doesn't make it at least into [section].js, test for the component's existence on the page and load the component's JS file. We're using <a title=\"Yepnope.js\" href=\"http://yepnopejs.com/\">yepnope</a> and have had minimal problems. In the same vein, if a component requires another component to work, require that component via the resource loader. Yepnope keeps up with what has been loaded and what hasn't, so it won't load duplicate scripts. I hear more advanced resource loaders might take care of these dependencies for you, but I don't have the hands on experience to provide insight into it.\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\nBuilding our site as an amalgamation of components caused some extra time during design and development. Building and testing each component individually results in extra testing time, but the benefits in maintainability and robustness far outweigh the initial time cost. We can iterate and improve components without worrying about how it will affect other pieces. We can add, remove, and replace components on pages without consequence. Keep it modular, keep everything decoupled. Production and development files should be optimized for each environment: lots of commented development files, few minified production files.\n\nMoving forward, we hope to also move our content to more modular, structured storage and presentation.", "published": "2013-10-17T14:00:35Z", "updated": "2020-03-19T20:42:00.687Z", "author": 1, "category": 13, "slug": "modular-front-end-web-development", "is_published": true, "syndicated_to_twitter": null, "syndicate_to_twitter": false, "tags": [285, 407, 408, 409, 410, 411, 412]}}, {"model": "posts.post", "pk": 54, "fields": {"title": "Recommended Reading, Volume 1", "summary": "", "content": "<h2>Life</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://iangent.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/the-petrie-multiplier-why-attack-on.html\">The Petrie Multiplier: Why an Attack on Sexism in Tech is NOT an Attack on Men</a></li>\t\r\n        <li><a href=\"http://mentalfloss.com/article/53216/mental-floss-exclusive-our-interview-bill-watterson\">Mental Floss Exclusive: Our Interview with Bill Watterson!</a></li>\t\r\n       <li><a href=\"http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/10/why-microsoft-word-must-die.html\">Why Microsoft Word must Die</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Web Development</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/objects-in-space/f6f404727\">Objects in Space: A style-guide for modular SASS development using SMACSS and BEM</a></li>\r\n</ul>", "published": "2013-10-19T03:59:33Z", "updated": "2020-03-19T20:42:00.689Z", "author": 1, "category": 16, "slug": "recommended-reading-volume-1", "is_published": true, "syndicated_to_twitter": null, "syndicate_to_twitter": false, "tags": []}}, {"model": "posts.post", "pk": 55, "fields": {"title": "A Decent Margarita", "summary": "", "content": "First, some ground rules: margaritas are to be served on the rocks with salt.

I tried again with some freshly purchased fresh ginger, but the flavor still wasn't there.</li>\n</ol>\n\nAt this point, the only aspect left that might affect the flavor is the sugar quantity. I didn't think that the sugar would affect the perceived spices this much, but I can't think of anything else that would be the difference. Perhaps, <em>perhaps</em>, I'm losing potency in my spices, but I can't imagine I'm losing so much flavor so quickly.\n\nEither it's the lack of sugar or the aging of my spices. I'm not interested in increasing the sugar. I want this drink to be available to me; I don't want to feel like it has to be an infrequent treat. If the spices truly are losing flavor this quickly, then I think I'll just have to resign myself to the fact that the flavor is subject to significant change from one brew to the next.\n\n<h2>Next Steps</h2>\nGiven that I'm unwilling to increase the sugar, I'm left with trying to extract more flavor from the spices. I have two plans to try and achieve this:\n<ol>\n\t<li><strong>More water and longer boil time:</strong> A longer boil should get more flavor out of the spices. More water will make up for the increased volume lost due to a longer boil. I'll start with 6 ounces (a 1.5 times increase) and boil it down to 4 ounces.</li>\n\t<li><strong>More water and more milk, all at the beginning, with a longer boil time:</strong> Perhaps putting all my liquid in at the beginning will help with extraction. I'll increase water and milk to 5 ounces each for a total of 10 ounces and boil down to 8 ounces. I'll then add my tea and steep.</li>\n</ol>", "published": "2013-10-29T14:00:26Z", "updated": "2020-03-19T20:42:00.719Z", "author": 1, "category": 15, "slug": "further-attempts-at-masala-chai", "is_published": true, "syndicated_to_twitter": null, "syndicate_to_twitter": false, "tags": [398, 413, 414]}}, {"model": "posts.post", "pk": 61, "fields": {"title": "OS X 10.9 Mavericks: The Ars Technica Review", "summary": "", "content": "<a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/10/os-x-10-9/\" title=\"OS X 10.9 Mavericks: The Ars Technica Review\">John Siracusa's OS X reviews</a> have done more to deepen my understanding of Apple's desktop platform and software philosophy than anything else.

It used progressive enhancement to build layers of functionality and polish. It worked well, that is, until touch.\r\n\r\n<h2>The Problem</h2>\r\n\r\nTake the example of a component that revealed additional content on hover.[foot]Let's leave aside the question of if revealing content on hover is a good design pattern. Let's assume there's sufficient affordance to communicate the available interaction to the user.[/foot] All of the relevant functionality can be achieved with CSS, but the touch experience isn't ideal. In iOS, a tap will trigger the hover state, but the user can't un-hover and return to the original state.\r\n\r\nSo we test for touch using <a href=\"http://modernizr.com/\" title=\"Modernizr\">Modernizr</a>, remove the hover styles for browsers that are touch-capable, and handle the touch interactions with JavaScript. iOS users are happy with a better experience. Now we turn to Windows 8; many Windows 8 devices have both a touchscreen and keyboard/mouse. IE10 users are fine because its <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/jj152135(v=vs.85).aspx\" title=\"Using aria-haspopup to simulate hover on touch-enabled devices\">alternative implementation</a> works really well. But non-IE users are left without their mouse triggering any effect. These users are left with a significant loss in functionality and experience.\r\n\r\nWe can no longer assume that devices have a single input.\r\n\r\n<h2>A Solution</h2>\r\nSo do we abandon our attempts at better touch interaction experiences? No, we need to go against what has seemed right so far: we need to move more of our functionality to JavaScript.\r\n\r\nOur original CSS hover base functionality needs to become our <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/6724530/814492\" title=\"What is the purpose of the HTML no-js class?\">no-js fallback functionality</a>. Let JavaScript handle the various interaction events: hover, touch, click, etc. and add/remove classes as desired to reflect the changing state of the component. CSS hooks into these dynamic classes to handle the required visual changes for each state change.\r\n\r\nMoving to this kind of interaction approach keeps all of the event handling in one place, the JavaScript; all of the appearance in one place, the CSS; and keeps our progressive enhancement with no-js hover states.", "published": "2013-11-04T15:00:58Z", "updated": "2020-03-19T20:42:00.745Z", "author": 1, "category": 13, "slug": "handling-touch-and-mouse-inputs", "is_published": true, "syndicated_to_twitter": null, "syndicate_to_twitter": false, "tags": [296, 379, 422, 423, 424, 425, 426, 427, 428]}}, {"model": "posts.post", "pk": 66, "fields": {"title": "Recommended Reading, Volume 4", "summary": "", "content": "<h2>Design</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a title=\"Design is never \u201cDone\u201d\" href=\"http://cvil.ly/2011/12/13/design-is-never-done/\">Design is never \u201cDone\u201d</a> (via <a title=\"@sambrown\" href=\"https://twitter.com/sambrown\">@sambrown</a>)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Web Development</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://unstoppablerobotninja.com/entry/responsive-web-design-screens-and-shearing-layers/\">Responsive Design, Screens, and Shearing Layers</a> (via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/beep/status/396705900209405952\">@beep</a>)</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1817\">On Using Viewports to Make Responsive Design Decisions</a> (via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lukew/status/397154914670882816\">@lukew</a>)</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.wired.com/opinion/2013/11/so-the-internets-about-to-lose-its-net-neutrality/\">We\u2019re About to Lose Net Neutrality \u2014 And the Internet as We Know It</a> (via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lukew/status/397562752547295233\">@lukew</a>)</li>\r\n\t<li><a title=\"Offline Support is Valuable, and You Can\u2019t Add it Later\" href=\"http://aanandprasad.com/articles/offline/\">Offline Support is Valuable, and You Can\u2019t Add it Later</a> (via <a title=\"Unstoppable Robot Ninja: Offline First\" href=\"http://unstoppablerobotninja.com/entry/offline-first/\">Unstoppable Robot Ninja)</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a title=\"High Performance Animations\" href=\"http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/high-performance-animations/\">High Performance Animations</a> (via <a title=\"Paul Irish\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/+PaulIrish/posts/DvqbCWpK8YT\">+PaulIrish</a>)</li>\r\n</ul>", "published": "2013-11-08T15:00:51Z", "updated": "2020-03-19T20:42:00.747Z", "author": 1, "category": 16, "slug": "recommended-reading-volume-4", "is_published": true, "syndicated_to_twitter": null, "syndicate_to_twitter": false, "tags": []}}, {"model": "posts.post", "pk": 67, "fields": {"title": "Creating Identicons", "summary": "", "content": "<img src=\"http://www.orangegnome.com/identicon/identicon.php?string=Orange%20Gnome&size=250\" alt=\"Identicon\" class=\"alignright size-small\" />Identicons are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identicon\">visual representations of text</a>. You've probably seen them before; they're often used as avatar replacements for users that haven't provided their own photo. When GitHub announced their <a href=\"https://github.com/blog/1586-identicons\">identicon implementation</a> for any users without a <a href=\"http://en.gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a>, I was struck by how personable they were. They didn't have the same appearance of geometrical abstraction, but looked like faces, pixel monsters, space invaders, or symbols. It was easy to presume meaning in them.\r\n\r\nFor whatever reason, I was moved to try and write an identicon implementation last night. Particularly after seeing that MD5 hashes are hexadecimal, so getting the color would be easy. I started with JavaScript because it's so easy to try things out by just opening a browser console, but found that there's not a native MD5 hashing function in JavaScript and quickly moved on over to PHP. GitHub was prominently my inspiration, particularly informing the 5x5 \"pixel\" grid.\r\n\r\nThe steps for the program are:\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>Get String</li>\r\n    <li>Convert string to MD5 hash</li>\r\n    <li>Extract identicon color from hash</li>\r\n    <li>Convert hash values to boolean values to determine each block in the 5x5 grid</li>\r\n    <li>Draw image based off of values</li>\r\n    <li>Output image</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.orangegnome.com/identicon/identicon.html\">See it in action</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2>Get String</h2>\r\nThis part is easy. It's a call to get a resource, so the string should be a GET parameter. I wanted the identicon to be case insensitive so that common case insensitive personal identifiers, like email addresses, would return the same image.\r\n\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>// Get string from query string\r\n$string = $_GET['string'] ? strtolower($_GET['string']) : \"\";</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<h2>Convert String to MD5 Hash</h2>\r\nThis is also easy with PHP; it has it's own MD5 hashing function.\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>// Get string from query string\r\n$string = $_GET['string'] ? strtolower($_GET['string']) : \"\";\r\n// Convert string to MD5\r\n$hash = md5($string);</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<h2>Extract identicon color from hash</h2>\r\nWith an MD5 hash, this is easy. We can just take the first six characters, and there's our hex color code.\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>// Get string from query string\r\n$string = $_GET['string'] ? strtolower($_GET['string']) : \"\";\r\n// Convert string to MD5\r\n$hash = md5($string);\r\n// Get color from first 6 characters\r\n$color = substr($hash, 0, 6);</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<h2>Convert Hash Values to Booleans</h2>\r\nI converted each hexadecimal character to decimal and then tested for odd or even to determine if a \"pixel\" in the identicon is turned on or off. Because I had the data available, I chose to offset my type conversion by the number of characters used to determine color.\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>// Get string from query string\r\n$string = $_GET['string'] ? strtolower($_GET['string']) : \"\";\r\n// Convert string to MD5\r\n$hash = md5($string);\r\n// Get color from first 6 characters\r\n$color = substr($hash, 0, 6);\r\n// Create an array to store our boolean \"pixel\" values\r\n$pixels = array();\r\n\r\n// Make it a 5x5 multidimensional array\r\nfor ($i = 0; $i &lt; 5; $i++) {\r\n    for ($j = 0; $j &lt; 5; $j++) {\r\n        $pixels[$i][$j] = hexdec(substr($hash, ($i * 5) + $j + 6, 1))%2 === 0;\r\n    }\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<h2>Draw Image</h2>\r\nI don't do much image manipulation, so this part was generally new to me. <code>imagecolorallocate</code> takes the color as RGB values, so the hex code needed to be converted. \r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>// Get string from query string\r\n$string = $_GET['string'] ? strtolower($_GET['string']) : \"\";\r\n// Convert string to MD5\r\n$hash = md5($string);\r\n// Get color from first 6 characters\r\n$color = substr($hash, 0, 6);\r\n// Create an array to store our boolean \"pixel\" values\r\n$pixels = array();\r\n\r\n// Make it a 5x5 multidimensional array\r\nfor ($i = 0; $i &lt; 5; $i++) {\r\n    for ($j = 0; $j &lt; 5; $j++) {\r\n        $pixels[$i][$j] = hexdec(substr($hash, ($i * 5) + $j + 6, 1))%2 === 0;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Create image\r\n$image = imagecreatetruecolor(400, 400);\r\n// Allocate the primary color. The hex code we assigned earlier needs to be decoded to RGB\r\n$color = imagecolorallocate($image, hexdec(substr($color,0,2)), hexdec(substr($color,2,2)), hexdec(substr($color,4,2)));\r\n// And a background color\r\n$bg = imagecolorallocate($image, 238, 238, 238);\r\n\r\n// Color the pixels\r\nfor ($k = 0; $k &lt; count($pixels); $k++) {\r\n    for ($l = 0; $l &lt; count($pixels[$k]); $l++) {\r\n        // Default pixel color is the background color\r\n        $pixelColor = $bg;\r\n        \r\n        // If the value in the $pixels array is true, make the pixel color the primary color\r\n        if ($pixels[$k][$l]) {\r\n            $pixelColor = $color;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        // Color the pixel.

My implementation has a few extras:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Accepts a size parameter</li>\r\n\t<li>Adds padding around the image</li>\r\n\t<li>Adds an extra layer of variance by using one of the hash characters to determine the \"switch\" of whether odd or even creates a filled pixel</li>\r\n\t<li>With the basic implementation, I felt that the results looked far too random. They didn't have near the personality that GitHub's identicons have. On closer inspection, I realized that their identicons are symmetrical. The right side is a mirror image of the left. I changed my pixel coloring algorithm to mirror the columns 1 and 2 in columns 4 and 5.

I remember trying to teach my son what my wife and I meant when we said that we \"needed him to tell us the truth.\" How do you ask a child to tell you the truth when that child has no understanding of what \"truth\" is? It became a habit to follow up requests of \"I need you to do X\" with the question, \"Do you know what X is?\"\r\n\r\nAnd so came the question, \"Do you know who God is?\" When he answered \"no,\" I fumbled for a place to begin. Where do you start with the infinite God? After a couple of starts, I found my footing with \"God is the one that created you and me and mommy and the entire world.\" I have since become more confident that this is an ideal context to begin an understanding of God. \"In the beginning was God, and God created everything.\" Speaking the universe into existence is a solid approach to the sheer power, timelessness, big-ness, and other-ness of God. It is a connection between an intangible supreme being and the physical world that my son can see, touch, and understand.\r\n\r\n<h2>The Value of Death</h2>\r\nI understand the desire to shield children from the knowledge of death. I was surprised myself by how early I needed to start fielding questions about death. \"What was our dog doing to that squirrel, daddy?\" \"What do lions eat?\" The circle of life actively imposes itself on our life, and it is a concept that must be actively guarded if a father wants to shield his child from the somber reality of death.\r\n\r\nI skirted the issue for a while, but found myself giving up and embracing the stance that my son not only should, but needs to have an understanding of death. We were reading about Jesus in his Bible story book, and I was telling him about who Jesus is and what He did for us and found that I couldn't do justice to it without talking about His death and resurrection, and I couldn't do justice to why that was important without talking about the inescapable and impending death awaiting each of us.\r\n\r\nJust as we cannot understand our need for reconciliation without an understanding of our own sin and brokenness, we cannot understand the gravity of the crucifixion and the beauty of the resurrection without an understanding of our natural state and its natural conclusion.\r\n\r\nI no longer have thoughts that it's my job to shield my children from the morbid realities of life, but rather to teach why these realities are as such, so that they may have a greater understanding of both themselves and the God Who loves them.\r\n\r\n<h2>Stories</h2>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>These commandments that I give you today are to be on your hearts. Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. <cite>Deuteronomy 6:6&ndash;7</cite></blockquote>\r\n\r\nRelated to both of the previous points is the question of how do we teach our children about the state of the world, the state of themselves, and the God who is there? I stumbled onto the answer in trying to teach my son who God is, and from the same answer came the revelation of the importance of a knowledge of death. And that answer is stories.\r\n\r\nGod commanded the Israelites to teach His commandments to their children. Just as the Israelites were to teach their children about the commandments, a tangible point of connection between God and His people, I've found the best way to teach my son about God is to teach him about these connection points between God and humanity.\r\n\r\nMost children's Bibles and Bible story books are horribly oversimplified. They gloss over important details and stop short of important conclusions. We have one that stops with the birth of Jesus, and, as I just mentioned, I find His death and resurrection to be vitally important. We have another, though, that I've been very pleased with. It's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Jesus-Storybook-Bible-Whispers/dp/0310708257\">The Jesus Storybook Bible</a>. Of course, it's highly paraphrased as a children's Bible needs to be, but it teaches the big concept of God's love, His Son's life and death, and why it's important without shying away from the realities of sin and death and brokenness. I highly recommend it.\r\n\r\nEven without a good children's Bible, I believe that faithfully sharing the stories of God's interaction with humanity throughout history is the best way to teach our children about God's love, our need for Him, and what He has done for us. On a more personal level, I believe there's value in sharing the stories of God's interaction with us individually.\r\n\r\n<h2>The Joy of Understanding</h2>\r\nA side effect of these approaches has been a deepening of my own understanding. I've spent so many years with a conceptual understanding of God and the human condition that it's easy to move past it. And that's generally a good thing: you can't tackle deeper concepts if you dwell on the simpler ones. But teaching these basic concepts to my son, and really having to explain them using even simpler concepts, has forced my mind to slow and focus on them. It has been good for my soul; I have found my heart being lifted by the joy of God's love for us, and I have found myself choked up talking about the gravity of what He has done through His son, Jesus.", "published": "2013-12-08T03:49:29Z", "updated": "2020-03-19T20:42:00.759Z", "author": 1, "category": 10, "slug": "on-training-our-children", "is_published": true, "syndicated_to_twitter": null, "syndicate_to_twitter": false, "tags": [260, 360]}}, {"model": "posts.post", "pk": 69, "fields": {"title": "Favorite Albums of 2013", "summary": "", "content": "It's the time of year when <a href=\"http://headphonesalwayson.tumblr.com/post/69492297274/contributor-post-daniel-d-s-10-favorite-albums-of\">folks</a> start putting out <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0i5XVKIMVEcN2ZhNGpZYmQxUXM/\">their</a> \"Best Of\" lists.

I keep an eye on NPR's First Listen and Pitchfork's Best New Music and listen to the albums. If I like the album, I add it to a yearly playlist on Spotify, which I listen to while I'm working. At the end of the year, I look back and cull the albums that I'm most fond of. This results, generally, in albums that stood out enough for me to see who it was while it was playing. Albums that are subtle in their quality or have a familiar sound tend to get lost in the process.

My shots were weak and watery. I compensated by using dark roasted beans and increasing the overall volume, but I knew that's all I was doing: compensating. I even began double grinding to try and get finer. It helped, but not enough to warrant the extra effort.\r\n\r\nFor Christmas, I received a new <a href=\"http://www.baratza.com/conical-burr-grinders/preciso-grinder/\" title=\"Baratza Preciso Grinder\">grinder</a> and am pulling my best shots yet.

My research shows that 14 grams is a minimum, and the roaster of <a href=\"http://www.batdorfcoffee.com/media/coffeereports/Dancing_Goats_Blend.pdf\" title=\"Batdorf & Bronson Dancing Goats Blend\">the beans I'm using</a> recommends 18\u201321 grams. I can eke out 16 grams with multiple tampings, but 18 seems out of reach. Part of the problem, I imagine, is that my machine takes a 50mm portafilter. Most espresso machines seem to take at least a 54mm portafilter. I don't know how much to make of the difference here. A bigger portafilter means a new machine, and I'm not ready for that investment at this time.</li>\r\n\t<li>My machine came with pressurized filter baskets. From what I can tell, these are designed to not allow water to pass through until a certain pressure is achieved. This is good for poor grinds, as it mitigates under-extraction, but its detrimental for good grinds because I don't have proper control and feedback on the quality of my grind and tamp. Breville makes a unpressurized filter basket for my portafilter, so that's a possible adjustment to make. It may not make a difference, but I'll never know until I try.</li>\r\n\t<li>Finally, I still may not be grinding fine enough. I will experiment with some finer grinds to see how that affects my shot times, and I'm going to ask to feel the grinds at my local coffee shop the next time I'm there, perhaps getting some advice from my barista at the same time.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nI'm happy with my grinder and excited to see how far I can take the rest of my setup.", "published": "2014-01-03T04:17:00Z", "updated": "2020-03-19T20:42:00.777Z", "author": 1, "category": 15, "slug": "on-the-pursuit-of-home-espresso", "is_published": true, "syndicated_to_twitter": null, "syndicate_to_twitter": false, "tags": []}}, {"model": "posts.post", "pk": 73, "fields": {"title": "In Defense of Southern Snow", "summary": "", "content": "When snow hits the South, it is often accompanied by condescending remarks about the South's seeming overreaction to \"just a little bit of snow.\" I don't argue that we don't see much snow in the South, or that we take conservative measures with it, but I do think the patronizing commentary on our plight is unwarranted.\r\n\r\nThe South is generally unprepared for wintry weather[foot]Excluding, perhaps, the southern Appalachian areas.[/foot], and I don't deny it, but our unpreparedness <em>is rational</em>. Here in Atlanta, we've seen snow accumulate twice in the past four years. We are inexperienced with snow, and there's no shame in that. There's no reason for the people of the South to be more prepared, and, more importantly, there's no reason for the municipalities to be more prepared. We lack the infrastructure to deal with snow, <em>and that's just as it should be</em>. Why should we invest in large numbers of salting trucks and snow plows for less-than-annual snowfalls? I certainly don't want my tax money going towards that. The result being cities and schools that shut down for a few days until everything thaws out. And that's okay; it's a lower cost than maintaining the infrastructure to effectively deal with the rare snow when it happens.\r\n\r\nThings thawing is actually the most overlooked issue with a southern snowfall. In colder climates that see snow regularly, the snow falls and builds and perhaps creates snow drifts or gets packed down and can become unwieldy snow. The infrastructure is ready and quick to work on the main roads and then the secondary roads. Here in the South, however, we do not have the infrastructure, as I mentioned, and we do not keep steadily cool temperatures. Our snow falls, melts during the day, and then freezes at night. Depending on how much snow falls and over how long of a period, we might see the melting/freezing cycle over several days. Our roads get crusty with frozen and refrozen ice, or, worse, they are deadly slick with thin, translucent patches of ice known as \"black ice.\"[foot]<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_ice\" title=\"Black ice\">Wikipedia: Black ice</a>[/foot] Our two or three inches of snow turns into dangerously icy roadways. We aren't freaking out about a few inches of snow; we're legitimately concerned because we know that roads the next morning may be impossibly dangerous to travel.

We do not have the need to invest in the public infrastructure necessary to handle snow and other winter weather in a timely manner, and our warmer climate transforms our insignificant amounts of snow into dangerous ice literally overnight. Don't talk down to us when we react strongly and conservatively.

My notes are much more extensive than this post, but these are the common themes I felt emerge from the various talks.\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"what-a-tangled-web-we-weave\">The Web is Complicated</h2>\r\nThe largest theme of the day was that the web has become complicated, and we need to be prepared for it. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/samanthatoy\" title=\"Samantha Warren on Twitter\">Samantha Warren</a> started this theme with her presentation of <a href=\"http://styletil.es/\" title=\"Style Tiles\">Style Tiles</a>. As building for the web has moved from fixed width sites to responsive, the way we communicate the visuals needs to adapt to become more flexible, allowing us iterate with our clients more efficiently and quickly. Style Tiles live between static mockups and mood boards. They communicate more than mood boards, without communicating the false certainty that accompanies mockups. They help communicate that we're not designing pages, we're designing a system from which pages and templates will be created.\r\n\r\nStyle Tiles look to be best used as aides during early design discussion. Once a project is mature, pattern libraries would be a better ongoing tool to centrally communicate the aesthetic and components that make up the system that makes up the website.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasonsantamaria\" title=\"Jason Santa Maria on Twitter\">Jason Santa Maria</a> touched on this theme in his discussion of the value of being flexible with your process. As he explained the need to move from the \"flat and fixed\" process that was the standard, with its manual file versioning and chaotic naming, he made the argument that such a process worked because the web was simpler medium then.\r\n\r\nThe theme really hit hard with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lukew\" title=\"Luke Wroblewski on Twitter\">Luke Wroblewski's</a> talk on designing for the increasing diversity of devices in use. We need to embrace the current state of devices, treating high resolution, wide screen devices as the dominant devices that they are. We need to leverage all the tools in our media query toolbox to design for the variety of devices on the market. Inputs are not mutually exclusive and are only increasing. We need to build in a way that accommodates various inputs interchangeably. A gigantic jump in the complexity of the web becomes apparent when we realize that TVs and smartphones have the same resolutions, but have completely different postural interactions. We need to respond to not only screen size but viewing distance, holding position, and environmental factors.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/grigs\" title=\"Jason Grigsby on Twitter\">Jason Grigsby</a> finished the theme with an incredibly practical overview of the needs of building websites mobile first. A big part of his talk involved emphasizing the importance of responsive image solutions. I've been hesitant implementing a responsive image solution because they all feel so hackish, like they're working against the browser instead of with it. Jason recognized this, saying that they <em>are</em> hacks, and we shouldn't overlook that fact. We should implement a solution in a way that we can change it later, because hacks can become obsolete very quickly.\r\n\r\nWe don't yet have great tools to deal with much of the complexity. We need to adapt our client communications and our designs in light of the ubiquity and complexity of the web platform. We need to build websites that are optimized for the data that we know, use reasonable proxies to optimize for the data that we don't know, and push for improved data for variables that don't have reasonable proxies.\r\n\r\n<h2>Prioritize Communication Over Tools or Process</h2>\r\nWhile Jason Santa Maria touched on the complexity of the web platform, he mostly hit on moving our focus from following a particular process to getting to the root of what processes are for: communication. We need to choose our tools and approaches based on the situation and use whatever communicates our ideas to our colleagues and clients most effectively and quickly.\r\n\r\nA sub-theme that tied in with Samantha Warren's talk was that of working in the appropriate fidelity at the appropriate points in a project. Communicating at less of a fidelity than what is needed leads to a discussion that isn't focused on the items that aren't ready to be discussed, while communicating at too high of a fidelity may lead to a discussion about details that don't need to be discussed yet.\r\n\r\nUse mood boards when you need to work through very abstract notions of a brand. Move to style tiles when it's time to focus those abstract notions into a design system. Start ideas on paper, moving them into mediums of higher and higher detail as those details are ready to come into focus. Move discussions about details to the lowest fidelity required. If a discussion on colors needs to be made, don't redo the style tiles or designs, work with color palettes until a solution is closer at hand.\r\n\r\n<h2>Communicate and Emphasize the Importance of Design</h2>\r\n\r\nThe final theme that emerged from the day was the need to communicate and emphasize the importance of design. I came in late to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zeldman\" title=\"Jeffrey Zeldman on Twitter\">Jeffrey Zeldman's</a> talk and missed most of it, but he ended it talking about the web industry needing evangelists more than it needs stars. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jmspool\" title=\"Jared Spool\">Jared Spool</a> took it home with the last talk of the day, though, showing how, if we want to be taken seriously, we need to demonstrate the value of our work to the strategic priorities of business.[foot]Increasing revenue, decreasing costs, increasing new business, increasing existing business, increasing shareholder value.[/foot] Additionally, we should take an active role in designing the business model to achieve the priorities so that we can work in a way that serves the user. When we develop strategies for revisions and improvements, we should communicate them in the context of the strategic priorities and measure them against those priorities. The more we work in the same world as our bosses and our bosses' bosses, the more positive influence we can have.\r\n\r\n<h2>Other Takeaways</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>All of the speakers look shorter in person than they do on Twitter.</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/CodingItWrong\" title=\"CodingItWrong on Twitter\">@CodingItWrong</a> had the best running Twitter commentary.</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/vitamintalent\" title=\"Vitamin T on Twitter\">Vitamin T</a> had a surprise hit with their dancing robots.</li>\r\n\t<li>I need to allow for more time to get into Buckhead from Decatur.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n", "published": "2014-02-18T03:57:58Z", "updated": "2020-03-19T20:42:00.789Z", "author": 1, "category": 13, "slug": "a-reflection-on-day-one-of-an-event-apart-atlanta", "is_published": true, "syndicated_to_twitter": null, "syndicate_to_twitter": false, "tags": [451, 452, 453, 454, 455, 456, 457, 458, 459, 460, 461, 462, 463]}}, {"model": "posts.post", "pk": 75, "fields": {"title": "A Reflection on Day Two of An Event Apart Atlanta", "summary": "", "content": "The second day of An Event Apart has wrapped up. I would say that only one new theme emerged, a couple of talks tied in with one of yesterday's themes, and a couple of talks stood on their own ground.\r\n\r\n<h2>Test Everything</h2>\r\nThe dominant theme in today's talks was the importance of testing. As builders on the web platform, we are accustomed to testing; it's long been an integral and needed part of the process. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jaffathecake\" title=\"Jake Archibald on Twitter\">Jake Archibald</a> summed it up well in his talk with the maxim \"tools not rules,\" meaning that we should trust our own experiences and tests in the browser over the possibly outdated or simply incorrect advice from others. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JennLukas\" title=\"Jenn Lukas on Twitter\">Jenn Lukas</a> emphasized the need to test web fonts across browsers and across devices, as they may be rendered very differently. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sazzy\" title=\"Sarah Parmenter on Twitter\">Sarah Parmenter's</a> talk on data driven design had the great suggestion to treat intuition as experiments. If we have a hunch that a certain implementation or revision will result in a specific change, we should plan an experiment and test that hunch.[foot]Parmenter also wisely observed that our hunches and intuitions are nothing but the ingrained result of our personal experience and subconscious data gathering.[/foot] While not directly addressing the need for testing, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wilto\" title=\"Mat Marquis on Twitter\">Mat Marquis</a> touched on it as he recounted the history of responsive image solutions. We need to test not only our designs, but our ideas, our hunches, and our solutions.\r\n\r\n<h2>Continuing on \"The Web is Complicated\"</h2>\r\nStaying on <a href=\"http://writings.orangegnome.com/writes/a-reflection-on-day-one-of-an-event-apart-atlanta/#what-a-tangled-web-we-weave\" title=\"A Reflection on Day One of An Event Apart Atlanta: The Web is Complicated\">the theme from yesterday</a>, Jake Archibald and Mat Marquis both demonstrated the complexity of the web. Archibald emphasized the diversity and seeming unpredictable nature of browser behavior while Marquis showed just how difficult it is to create, evolve, and implement web standards.\r\n\r\n<h2>Unrelated Ideas</h2>\r\nI didn't feel that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kevinmhoffman\" title=\"Kevin Hoffman on Twitter\">Kevin Hoffman</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Malarkey\" title=\"Andrew Clarke on Twitter\">Andrew Clarke's</a> talks fit with any of the emerged themes, but they were both excellent talks. Perhaps I could shoehorn their ideas into my themes, but I think that would be a disservice to the points they were making.[foot]Hoffman talked about \"experimental design,\" which could be thrown in with the \"Test Everything\" theme, and Clarke advised us to challenge ideas, which could also be grouped with \"Test Everything.\"[/foot] Hoffman gave an inspiring talk on working collaboratively and effectively. I look forward to incorporating many of his ideas and suggestions into my projects. Clarke gave a very high-level closing talk, encouraging us, essentially, to be ourselves: to find the best medium for us to work in, to focus on results over methods, to challenge ourselves and others, and invest in achieving and contributing our own great ideas.\r\n\r\n<h2>Other Takeaways</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A <a href=\"http://picture.responsiveimages.org/\" title=\"The picture Element\">responsive image solution</a> is currently being implemented by some browsers!</li>\r\n\t<li>Mat Marquis has a fantastic combination of gravitas and levity.</li>\r\n\t<li>Jake Archibald know how to make an epic introduction.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n", "published": "2014-02-19T02:35:57Z", "updated": "2020-03-19T20:42:00.797Z", "author": 1, "category": 13, "slug": "a-reflection-on-day-two-of-an-event-apart-atlanta", "is_published": true, "syndicated_to_twitter": null, "syndicate_to_twitter": false, "tags": [451, 452, 461, 462, 463, 464, 465, 466, 467, 468, 469, 470]}}, {"model": "posts.post", "pk": 76, "fields": {"title": "Notes on Luke Wroblewski's \"Mobile Design Now\" Workshop", "summary": "", "content": "<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lukew\" title=\"Luke Wroblewski on Twitter\">Luke Wroblewski</a> takes and shares <a href=\"http://www.lukew.com/ff?tag=aeaatlanta2014\" title=\"Articles about Aeaatlanta2014 from the LukeW writing archives.\">great notes from talks that he attends</a>.

I'm not really having that issue. Mobile is big and in our face at <a href=\"http://goizueta.emory.edu\" title=\"Emory's Goizueta Business School\">Goizueta</a>. We are well aware of the need to address mobile needs. Finding the resources to make mobile accommodations in the many places that need it is our main challenge.\r\n\r\n<h3>Our Design Bias</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>We spend most of our time looking at our computer, and have been working with computers for a long time</li>\r\n\t<li>We use the mouse and keyboard to build things and we are building things that use the mouse and keyboard</li>\r\n\t<li>We have lots to learn and lots to unlearn</li>\r\n\t<li>There is a difference between being thinking mobile-centric and thinking desktop-centric plus porting to mobile</li>\r\n\t<li>We are mostly being desktop-centric plus porting</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nThis is so very true. We are steeped in desktop experience and thinking. We have so much less experience working with mobile, an environment that is not only new but rapidly changing and improving. We should cut ourselves some slack for mobile mistakes, but we need to press on and learn and adjust and adapt.\r\n\r\n<h2>Design Considerations</h2>\r\n<h3>Product Vision</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The central idea or concept.</li>\r\n\t<li>\"What are we making, for whom, and why?\"</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Design Principles</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Characteristics used to evaluate decisions</li>\r\n\t<li>Whenever someone has an idea, it needs to be validated against the concrete and stated design principles</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Design Considerations</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>How/what to think about while designing</li>\r\n\t<li>Shake off desktop tendencies</li>\r\n\t<li>Think and create in a mobile \"native\" way</li>\r\n\t<li>Make informed decisions</li>\r\n\t<li>Mobile devices have a lot of data about the current context</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Layout &amp; Navigation</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>How do we organize and present mobile screens</li>\r\n\t<li>Think outside the display box</li>\r\n\t<li>Going from desktop to mobile, the tendency is to stack the content</li>\r\n\t<li>Offscreen elements makes use of all directions.

I was aware of Tonx through various mentions on Twitter, but was able to give them a try through their <a title=\"Tonx Gift Card Exchange\" href=\"https://tonx.org/better\">Starbucks gift card exchange program</a>, as I had received a Starbucks gift card from Christmas.\r\n\r\n<h2>Overview</h2>\r\nThe service is pretty straightforward; Tonx offers three levels of subscriptions: 6 ounces for $12, 12 ounces for $19, and 24 ounces for $34. Beans are roasted every other Sunday and shipped on Monday. They source and roast the beans themselves, providing tasting notes and information about the people and farms growing the beans in each batch. The emphasis is on making better coffee from better beans, freshly roasted.\r\n\r\n<h2>In Action</h2>\r\nMy gift card allowed me two shipments, so my data sample is admittedly small. The beans were good quality, lightly roasted, and single origin.[foot]Single origin means that the beans come from a single geographic region. The <a title=\"Tonx Quilanga\" href=\"https://tonx.org/releases/quilanga\">first batch</a> was the from two farms in the Quilanga Cant\u00f3n of Loja, Ecuador. The <a title=\"Tonx Iwacu\" href=\"https://tonx.org/releases/iwacu\">second batch</a> was from a single coffee processing mill in Nyanza, Rwanda.[/foot] Lightly roasted seems to be the trend for high quality beans and seems to result in brighter, fruitier flavors.[foot]Or perhaps brighter, fruitier beans tend to be more lightly roasted. Chicken &amp; egg.[/foot] Single origin coffees are supposed to be purer expressions of the coffee's <i>terroir</i>.[foot]<a title=\"Brent Lineberry on Twitter\" href=\"http://twitter.com/brentlineberry\">Give me a shout</a> if I'm off-base on my impressions of light roasts and single origins.[/foot]\r\n\r\nThe theory of roasting on Sunday, shipping on Monday, and receiving freshly roasted coffee beans a few days later sounds good. The reality is that, for the coffee to ship from California to Georgia, the coffee didn't arrive until Thursday,[foot]In reality reality, the beans didn't arrive for me until Friday. They were schedule for Thursday, but we had Snowjam 2014 and Snowjam Pt II the two weeks that the beans were shipping, so they got delayed.[/foot] unable to use until Friday morning's coffee, so the coffee was 4\u201318 days old during its course in the house. Compared to Starbucks or Supermarket coffee, this is extremely fresh. For home espresso,[foot]<a title=\"On the Pursuit of Home Espresso\" href=\"http://writings.orangegnome.com/writes/on-the-pursuit-of-home-espresso/\">Which I've really gotten into lately</a>.[/foot] though, it gets on the old side toward the end.\r\n\r\nOn a user experience note, the website is fantastic. It is a pleasure to use, with a wonderful aesthetic. It houses a wealth of relevant information in addition to the basic functionality of account and subscription management. Kudos to the designers and developers there.\r\n<h2>Cancelling</h2>\r\nMy main hangup with Tonx had nothing to do with Tonx and everything to do with the fact that I have convenient access to <a title=\"Batdorf &amp; Bronson\" href=\"http://www.batdorfcoffee.com/\">great, locally roasted coffee</a> within three miles of my house. I can get great coffee roasted yesterday, so I didn't want to continue my subscription.\r\n\r\nWhen it came time to cancel, finding how to do so was no problem. Tonx lets you pause a subscription for several weeks or cancel your subscription altogether. When I went to cancel, I had not yet been billed for the difference between my gift card balance and the cost for the last shipment. They gave a little notice by the Cancel button that I owed $6 and they would be collecting that even after I cancelled. I figured that I would just wait for that to get settled and then cancel. When I came back to cancel, I had been charged for the next month's subscription, and when canceling, the little notice said that my subscription would be cancelled after the paid shipments have shipped. To be fair, this is exactly how they state that the payments and deliveries are done, but, having funded my subscription with a gift card, this was my first experience with it. I was particularly irritated by the automatic shipment of the remainder of my charges instead of refunding, or giving the option for a refund. I sent a message to their customer service and within a few hours I had a notice saying that my account had been canceled and the balance refunded. I didn't have to fight or argue my point. It was good customer service.\r\n<h2>Recommendation</h2>\r\nOverall Tonx provides a great service. If good quality, freshly roasted coffee is unavailable locally, I definitely recommend Tonx as a means to obtain it.

I want to give a summary of how we did it.\r\n\r\nOur site is quite large; content and assets are edited by multiple people, managed and overseen by a Marketing and Communications team. A responsive images solution needed to be dead easy for everyone. We needed a solution that didn't add a single step to the content editors' workflow or to the marketing team's asset preparation workflow. We moved forward with a server-side image resizer coupled with the new srcset + sizes img syntax using Picturefill 2.0 to polyfill.\r\n\r\n<h2>Server-Side Image Resizer</h2>\r\nI began with the expectation that I would be writing this service myself, but as I researched conventions and best practices, I came across <a href=\"http://imageresizing.net/\" title=\"ImageResizer\">ImageResizer</a> and realized that anything I tried to do would essentially be a copy of this. We went with the Performance license because we knew that caching is a must for a production environment. We have also found the need for the PrettyGifs plugin that comes with that license.\r\n\r\nImageResizer works best as an IIS module, intercepting requests and applying any image adjustments in the query string. I like this approach because it means that if we someday remove the service, we don't have a bunch of dead links to tend to; the original image will get served as expected.\r\n\r\nThe only hiccup we came across was that all .NET applications running under the main need to have the ImageResizer dlls in their bin directories too, but not a huge deal.\r\n\r\n<h2>Srcset + Sizes</h2>\r\nWhile the <code>picture</code> element seemed to received all of the publicity during the <a href=\"http://responsiveimages.org/\" title=\"Responsive Images Community Group\">developer driven responsive images campaign</a>, the information pointed to the srcset + sizes variant as the best fit for our needs. Eric Portis has <a href=\"http://ericportis.com/posts/2014/srcset-sizes/\" title=\"Srcset and Sizes by Eric Portis\">the best explanation I've come across for implementing srcset + sizes</a>. Interestingly, <a href=\"http://blog.cloudfour.com/dont-use-picture-most-of-the-time/\" title=\"Don't Use Picture Most of the Time\">several</a> <a href=\"http://css-tricks.com/responsive-images-youre-just-changing-resolutions-use-srcset/\" title=\"Responsive Images: If you\u2019re just changing resolutions, use srcset.\">articles</a> have come out recently talking about how srcset + sizes is most often the best approach.\r\n\r\nOur site CMS is <a href=\"http://www.hannonhill.com/\" title=\"Hannon Hill\">Hannon Hill's Cascade Server</a>, which is heavy on XML as a data mechanism and XSLT for HTML output. While working in this framework often feels archaic, it ideally suits implementing img srcset + sizes without needing anything from the content and asset editors. The content goes through a couple of XSL transforms before it's output as HTML, which means that we can easily add the srcset and size attributes to any image elements that we want. We started with the lowest hanging fruit, our gigantic landing page slider images, and by the end we were transforming <code>img</code> elements in all the content, sidebar, and landing page areas.\r\n\r\nFor the sizes, we looked at our analytics to find the most common resolutions, and then for each content \"well\" in the layout, we calculated the size needed at each of those resolutions. That went in as the sizes attribute, and the srcset attribute was just a matter of taking each of those sizes and denoting it in the query string for the image. The ImageResizer takes care of generating and caching the requested sizes.\r\n\r\nThis means that the marketing team can upload one image, the biggest they have, and not worry about resizing it for the many places it may be used. Anyone can use the images, in any place, without any consideration about what size to use. The ImageResizer and the XSLT make sure that the HTML output is good and that the right sized image is being served. And by focusing on our most common screen resolutions, over 80% of our site visitors are getting exactly the right sized image.\r\n\r\n<h2>Picturefill</h2>\r\nAt this point we have a server-side image resizer and responsive images markup, but <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#feat=srcset\" title=\"Can I Use Srcset attribute?\">browsers don't natively support srcset + sizes</a> yet. Picturefill covers the gap here. It wasn't until <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wilto\" title=\"Mat Marquis on Twitter\">Mat Marquis</a> announced that the picture element and the new srcset + sizes syntax were on the verge of browser implementation at <a href=\"http://aneventapart.com/event/atlanta-2014\" title=\"An Event Apart Atlanta, 2014\">An Event Apart Atlanta</a> that I felt confident in a responsive images solution that wasn't a hack, and when <a href=\"http://scottjehl.github.io/picturefill/\" title=\"Picturefill\">picturefill 2.0</a> was released, with spec-matching syntax, I knew this would be our implementation.\r\n\r\nPicturefill 2.0 is a true polyfill, meaning that it only acts to replicate missing native functionality. If the browser supports responsive images, then it does nothing. As browsers start shipping this functionality, we can remove the polyfill and leave those using browsers without support with the fallback.\r\n\r\nPicturefill recommends not using a src attribute in img elements and letting the alt text be the fallback. The native implementation's fallback is the src attribute; that's the image to serve for browsers that don't support responsive images. Picturefill recommends against it because it means a double download. Browsers will download the image in the src attribute, picturefill will do it's math and src swapping, then the browser will download the new image.\r\n\r\nWe decided on a mobile first approach, using the smallest size image for the src. So, yes, it gets downloaded, but there's no penalty for small screens, and the gains far outweigh the cost as screen sizes increase. Once browsers support this natively, it won't get downloaded, and when support reaches the point where we can remove the polyfill, browsers without support will just get the small image.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nThis implementation has been in production for two months now. I'm very proud of it, from the programmatic server-side image resizing to the absolute absence of any changes to workflows.", "published": "2014-10-02T02:49:15Z", "updated": "2020-03-19T20:42:00.816Z", "author": 1, "category": 13, "slug": "implementing-responsive-images-in-a-production-environment", "is_published": true, "syndicated_to_twitter": null, "syndicate_to_twitter": false, "tags": [285, 451, 452, 461, 474, 475, 476, 477, 478, 479, 480, 481]}}, {"model": "posts.post", "pk": 79, "fields": {"title": "Treating the Web as a \"Platform\"", "summary": "", "content": "I haven't previously weighed in on the native apps versus web debate.

Once you start trading access for <a href=\"http://engineering.flipboard.com/2015/02/mobile-web/\" title=\"60 FPS on the Mobile Web\">animations</a>, access for <a href=\"http://webcomponents.org/\" title=\"Web Components\">modularity and encapsulation</a>, or access for <a href=\"https://angularjs.org/\" title=\"Angular JS\">client</a>-<a href=\"http://emberjs.com/\" title=\"Ember.js\">side</a> functionality, you're trading away the biggest strength the web offers.\r\n\r\nIf you build a native app, you know that only those on your target platform will have access. And that's okay, you've made that tradeoff decision up front. \r\n\r\nThere seems to be a common idea (or maybe it's just loud) in the web community that we can treat the JavaScript-enabled browser as a platform and build something native-like that hits anything that has a browser. Well, anything that has a modern, JavaScript-enabled browser. And by \"modern,\" we mean \"meets all the requirements for my framework.\"\r\n\r\n<h2>The Problem of Web as Platform</h2>\r\nI don't have a fundamental problem with building for target audiences that are smaller than \"anyone with a web browser.\" I do think that trying to achieve larger reach by publishing to the web and then limiting that reach by requiring a certain level of browser functionality is confusing, but that's not the real problem. The real problem is that we know so little about the environment in which our product will be used.\r\n\r\nRight now, today, we cannot reliably implement gestures in websites. The risk for colliding with native gestures in the mobile browser is just too great.\r\n\r\nThe Web, and web apps by extension, exist as an app inside an app. The browser is not an OS, it's an app: it has its own gestures, interface, and controls. And our websites exist inside of them. It's not just a needed-functionality problem; it's a UI problem. Are we placing our UI controls right next to the browser controls? Are our gestural power-features conflicting with the browser's gestures?\r\n\r\nBuilding for the web requires a certain amount of letting go, a level of agnosticism towards platform and environment. We cannot treat the browser (or webview) as a clean environment; it has its own opinions.\r\n\r\n<h3>\"Native-Like\": A Brief Sidebar</h3>\r\nI've come to believe that web apps will never truly rival native apps, for a single, simple reason: user interface conventions. iOS and Android have conflicting UI conventions. Take tab bars as an example: iOS guides you to put them at the bottom of the view, within easy access of the user's thumb; Android guides you to put them at the top, so as to not conflict with the ever-present Back, Home, and Recents OS/hardware controls. When we first began building sites for mobile after the iPhone, the web, at mobile sizes, was designed to look like iOS. Now, though, mobile web design has largely embraced the same conclusion that we reached on the desktop: the website can contain its own design conventions and shouldn't mimic the OS. This is a good place to be. Web apps shouldn't attempt OS-level cohesiveness.\r\n\r\n<h2>What We Need for True \"Web Apps\"</h2>\r\nTo truly achieve a native-like experience with web technologies, we need an opinion-less environment, and we need to know when our web app is being run in such an environment versus a browser or another app's webview. This may be met by the <a href=\"https://w3c.github.io/manifest/\" title=\"Manifest for web application\">HTML5 Web Application Manifest</a>, or something similar, I don't know. I do know that it's not being met currently.\r\n\r\nIf we know that our website is being run as such, we can make assumptions about our environment and treat our session as a native app that happens to be built with web technologies, otherwise we can default to an ubiquitous, environment-agnostic site. \r\n\r\nAnd there's a lot of power in ubiquitous, environment-agnostic sites.\r\n\r\n<h2>A Plan From Here</h2>\r\nMy current strategy doesn't change. Build for the web because of its reach. Build for the web for everyone. Build for the web first; it's reach is too large to ignore. Build for native for what native can provide: hardware access, gesture support, and an experience coherent with the OS.\r\n\r\nPerhaps soon we'll be able to take advantage of more and more of these native functionalities with web technologies that run as first-class apps. But we're not there yet.", "published": "2015-02-19T02:52:14Z", "updated": "2020-03-19T20:42:00.818Z", "author": 1, "category": 13, "slug": "treating-the-web-as-a-platform", "is_published": true, "syndicated_to_twitter": null, "syndicate_to_twitter": false, "tags": []}}, {"model": "posts.post", "pk": 80, "fields": {"title": "Scheduled Task Frequency", "summary": "Automated tasks should be scheduled not on how frequently the underlying data changes, but by the organization's toleran", "content": "Automated tasks should be scheduled not on how frequently the underlying data changes, but by the organization's tolerance for out of date data once it does change.\r\n\r\nTwice this week I've been in conversations discussing how frequently a script should run. In both contexts, the first question was \"how frequently does the data change?\" In both cases, large changes happen about three times a year, with small one-off changes happening infrequently in-between. But the better question is \"once a change happens, how much delay can we tolerate before it is updated throughout the system?\" How frequently data changes is a red herring.

Many frameworks have supported channels and APIs that allow custom connections to unsupported channels.\r\n\r\nA third piece common, but not required, is artificial intelligence. A common one is Natural Language Processors (NLP), which takes text and pulls intents and values according to some machine learning, but there are others for speech analysis, parsing FAQ-style data for conversational questioning and answering, and more.\r\n\r\nWe surveyed the landscape and found lots of products in the chatbot space, many that blur the edges between the framework, channel, and artificial intelligence pieces. A sampling of the pieces we found are:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>BotKit</li>\r\n \t<li>Amazon Lex</li>\r\n \t<li>IBM Watson</li>\r\n \t<li>Facebook Wit</li>\r\n \t<li>Google DialogFlow</li>\r\n \t<li>Microsoft Bot Framework</li>\r\n \t<li>Microsoft LUIS</li>\r\n \t<li>Microsoft QnA Maker</li>\r\n \t<li>Microsoft Text Analytics API</li>\r\n \t<li>Microsoft Bing Spell check</li>\r\n \t<li>Microsoft Bing Speech API</li>\r\n \t<li>Microsoft Bing Web Search API</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOur team settled on Microsoft Bot Framework for the framework and Microsoft LUIS for the NLP. We're a Microsoft environment, so these were natural extensions of the products and services we already use.\r\n<h2>Things that are easy</h2>\r\nAfter spending some time trying to build some concrete solutions with chatbots, we discovered a few things that are easy to do:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Workflows with discrete steps.</strong> Any user path that has sequential, distinct steps is straightforward with Microsoft DialogFlow. It has a prompts for different types of data, state management, and input validation all out of the box.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>FAQ.</strong> Microsoft's QnA Maker makes quick work of any kind of FAQ-style data source, and then uses machine learning to allow the chat bot to handle natural language questions and return relevant answers.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Discerning general intent.</strong> With LUIS, figuring out, broadly, what the user is wanting to do is easy.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Handling common tasks that have a concrete action.</strong> Any time you can say \"when the user says something along the lines of [x], do [y]\" is easy.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Things that are hard</h2>\r\nOutside of the easy things, there are many things that we want to do, but are hard:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Context switching.</strong> Let's say a user is in the middle of a DialogFlow, one of the easy things, but they respond with something that indicates they want to do something else. What happens here? Do you make them finish the DialogFlow? Do you cancel the DialogFlow and lose all of their progress? Do you save the state and return them to it when they're done with the interruption? Do you ask if they want to return when they're done? The hard part here is that there isn't a best approach, all of these could be viable options depending on the user and their context.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>State management. </strong>Our natural conversations are full of micro-state changes. We talk about something, that leads to something else, which then goes back to a previous comment. Tracking the state that matters versus the state that doesn't is hard.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Revising intent.</strong> Part of state management, anytime the user has sent a message that has intent, but then wants to revise that intent in a follow up message, this is hard!</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Natural Language Processing of items with small differences.</strong> LUIS is impressive and gives you a lot right out of the box, but training it to differentiate between similar but different intents is difficult.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Any tasks that require analysis or nuance. </strong>Chatbots cannot replace humans. Anything that requires a human to analyze or understand the intent cannot be done with a chatbot (obviously, right?).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Early conclusions</h2>\r\nWe're still at the beginning of this whole thing, but some conclusions stand out already. Chatbots are good at handling common, easily understood tasks. As a front-line for customer service, or as a different interaction model around a knowledge base, they can offer users a new, and perhaps better, way of getting the information they need. That's what we're keeping an eye out for: user interactions that currently require a person to deliver a concrete answer or solution to a concrete question.", "published": "2018-12-12T15:06:34Z", "updated": "2020-03-19T20:42:00.827Z", "author": 1, "category": 13, "slug": "early-learnings-with-chatbots", "is_published": true, "syndicated_to_twitter": null, "syndicate_to_twitter": false, "tags": [482, 483, 484, 485, 486]}}, {"model": "posts.post", "pk": 82, "fields": {"title": "Changing Platforms", "summary": "", "content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I'm looking at changing my entire personal site platform.
